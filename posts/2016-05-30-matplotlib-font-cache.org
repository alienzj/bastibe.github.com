#+title: Updating the Matplotlib Font Cache

When publishing papers or articles, I want my plots to integrate with the text surrounding them. I want them to use the correct font size, and the correct font.

This is easy to do with Matplotlib:

#+begin_src python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.rcParams['font.size'] = 12
matplotlib.rcParams['font.family'] = 'Calibri'
#+end_src

However, sometimes, Matplotlib won't find the correct, even though it is clearly installed. This happens when Matplotlib's internal font cache is out of date.

To refresh the font cache, use

#+begin_src python
matplotlib.font_manager._rebuild()
#+end_src

Happy Plotting!
