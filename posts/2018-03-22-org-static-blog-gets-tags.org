#+title: Blogging with org-static-blog

A while ago, I scratched an old itch and wrote my own static site generator, called [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog][org-static-blog]]. It is a simple thing: You hand it a directory full of *.org files with a ~#+title:~ and ~#+date:~, and it assembles a bunch of HTML pages and an RSS feed from them. There are no external dependencies beyond Emacs.

Today, I [[http://melpa-stable.milkbox.net/#/org-static-blog][released]] version 1.1.0 of org-static-blog, which introduces two new features: [[http://bastibe.de/2018-03-17-speeding-up-org-static-blog.html][speed]], and tags. You can now—optionally—add ~#+tags:~ to your *.org files, ~(setq org-static-blog-enable-tags t)~, and org-static-blog will add tag links to every blog post, create tag indices, and add ~<category>~ tags to the RSS feed.
