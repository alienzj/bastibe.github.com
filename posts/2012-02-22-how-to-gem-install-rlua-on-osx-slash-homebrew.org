#+title: How to gem install rlua on OSX/homebrew

If you want to use rlua, you need to have Lua installed. However, OSX does not come with Lua preinstalled, so you install it using

#+begin src sh
    brew install lua
#end_src

Oh, would it be nice if everyone agreed on how to install stuff like this. Case in point, homebrew installs liblua (quite reasonable) in ~/usr/local/lib/liblua.[5.1[.4]].dylib~

rlua however expects it to be called ~liblua5.1.dylib~ (notice the missing ~.~).

Similarly, the headers are installed plainly into ~/usr/local/include~, whereas rlua expects them to be in a folder called ~lua5.1~.

Hence, here is how you get rlua to install:

#+begin_src sh
    ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/lua/5.1.4/lib/liblua.5.1.4.dylib /usr/local/lib/liblua5.1.dylib
    ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/lua/5.1.4/include/ /usr/local/include/lua5.1
#+end_src

Not exactly a beautiful solution, but it works.
