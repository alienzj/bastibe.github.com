In iPython 2.0, they introduced a new feature, [[http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Interactive%20Widgets/Index.ipynb][interactive widgets]]. In a nutshell, these provide graphical widgets in your notebook, which can call functions.

I first noticed the Audio widget, which produces a little audio player in your notebook.
