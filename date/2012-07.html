<p>A while ago, I bought a Time Capsule to take care of my backups. I can't say it has been smooth sailing. Every now and then, the Time Capsule would claim that the backup did fail. Sometimes a reboot would help, sometimes not. Sometimes <code>hdiutil</code> would be able to salvage the backups, sometimes not. Sometimes, the backup disk image would simply be corrupted and the only option would be to delete it and start over.</p>

<p>This might be bad luck or it might be due to a defective Time Capsule or it might be due to my computer. I have no idea. But the thing is, if I have to hack on my backup system anyway, lets do it in style, at least. So here goes:</p>

<h3>Ingredients: <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" >A Raspberry Pi</a>, an external hard drive, some patience</h3>

<p>Format an SD card as described <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup" >in the wiki</a>. I just installed the version of Debian that is provided on <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads" >the official website</a>. Now just boot up.</p>

<p>Next, I was stumped because I only have an Apple LED display and no convenient way of connecting the Raspberry Pi's HDMI output to the LED display's Mini Display Port. After some searching and a combination of three adapter cables, I finally got it connected and could see it boot. Really, I have no use whatsoever for the HDMI port on the Raspberry pi. So the first thing I did was to enable SSH, which luckily is available right there in the configuration utility that starts when you boot the thing for the first time.</p>

<p>After that, I disconnected the display and immediately was stumped because I now had no way of finding the Pi's IP address. Actually, I did not even have a network to connect it to. So I strung an ethernet cable from my laptop to the Pi and enabled <em>Internet Sharing</em> in order to (1) start the DHCP server and (2) give the Pi internet access. The IP address was then easily found using <code>arp -a</code>.</p>

<h3>Setting up the hard drive</h3>

<p>First off, I needed to format and mount my external hard drive to be usable as a Time Machine volume. <code>ls /dev</code> showed the hard drive as <code>/dev/sda</code>. Thus, I installed <code>parted</code> using <code>sudo apt-get install parted</code> and used it <code>sudo parted</code>. In parted, <code>select /dev/sda</code> sets it up to modify the external hard drive, <code>rm 1</code> deleted its main partition, <code>q</code> to quit parted. Next, creating a new partition: <code>sudo fdisk</code>, then in there <code>n</code> with <code>p</code> and <code>1</code> to create a new primary partition, then <code>w</code> to apply the changes and exit. Lastly, I created the file system with <code>sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda1</code> with the whole partition as its size. Now lastly, I created a mount point for it using <code>mkdir ~/TimeMachine</code> (don't use <code>sudo</code>!) and auto-mounted it by appending this to <em>/etc/fstab</em></p>

<pre><code>/dev/sda1 /home/pi/TimeMachine ext4 rw,auto,user,exec,sync 0 0
</code></pre>

<p>Note: <code>sync</code> specifies that all file system changes have to be written to disk immediately, without caching. This might be bad for performance, but on the other hand, this behavior is probably a good idea for a backup system. I once read something somewhere that Apple is enforcing a similar behavior on their Time Capsules and that this is the reason why they won't allow any other network drive as Time Capsules.</p>

<h3>Setting up the shared folder</h3>

<p>First up, this requires <code>netatalk</code>, so I did <code>sudo apt-get update</code> and <code>sudo apt-get install netatalk</code> to install it. Next, netatalk has to be configured to actually share the drive on the network. This is accomplished by appending this line to <em>/etc/netatalk/AppleVolumes.default</em>:</p>

<pre><code>/home/pi/TimeMachine TimeMachine allow:pi cnidscheme:dbd options:upriv,usedot,tm
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the afp daemon should be configured to use the proper authentification schemes. Thus, add this to <em>/etc/netatalk/afpd.conf</em>:</p>

<pre><code>- -transall -uamlist uams_randnum.so,uams_dhx.so,uams_dhx2.so -nosavepassword -advertise_ssh
</code></pre>

<p>(maybe append <code>mdns</code> to the hosts in <em>/etc/nsswitch.conf</em>? Probably not necessary.)</p>

<p>I am also not quite sure whether I actually had to create a new file <em>/etc/avahi/services/afpd.service</em> and write into it:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?&gt;&lt;!--*-nxml-*--&gt;
    &lt;!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd"&gt;
    &lt;service-group&gt;
        &lt;name replace-wildcards="yes"&gt;%h&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;service&gt;
            &lt;type&gt;_afpovertcp._tcp&lt;/type&gt;
            &lt;port&gt;548&lt;/port&gt;
        &lt;/service&gt;
        &lt;service&gt;
            &lt;type&gt;_device-info._tcp&lt;/type&gt;
            &lt;port&gt;0&lt;/port&gt;
            &lt;txt-record&gt;model=Xserve&lt;/txt-record&gt;
        &lt;/service&gt;
    &lt;/service-group&gt;</code></pre>

<p>And maybe, you have to create an empty file that signifies the drive as Time Machine compatible using <code>touch ~/TimeMachine/.com.apple.timemachine.supported</code>.</p>

<p>I certainly did all that, but I am not quite sure which of these steps were strictly necessary. If you know, please let me, too.</p>

<p>Anyway, with all that done, restart both the netatalk and the Bonjour daemon using <code>sudo /etc/init.d/netatalk restart</code> and <code>sudo /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon restart</code>n.</p>

<h3>Setting up the Time Machine</h3>

<p><strike>Now, back to the Mac. In order to make Time Machine accept the new network share, run</p>

<pre><code>defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1
</code></pre>

<p></strike>
<strong>Edit:</strong> Turns out, this setting is not necessary. OSX just picks the Raspberry Pi as a usable Time Machine drive by default.</p>

<p>Finally, the TimeMachine folder on the Raspberry Pi was available as one of the backup drives. Halleluja!</p>

<p>Now transfer speeds for the initial backup are not exactly what I would call fast, but this might not be the Pi's fault. For one thing, the Pi is reporting to only run at half load. For another thing, the external hard drive and its USB connection is probably not very speedy. And lastly, I seem to remember that initial backups always were slow. But really, only time will tell how well this thing can do the job of a Time Capsule.</p>

<p>Further testing shows that transfer speeds are very comparable to the Time Capsule. Thus, I declare this a raging success!</p>

<p>I bought my first Apple computer in 2007 after a long time of gaming on Windows and a few years of Linux. In the beginning, I was just amazed at the consistency, practicality and sanity of the whole experience. I think I had a bad case of tinkeritis and neophilia in my Linux days, so this was probably to be expected.</p>

<p>Later, I marveled at the level of polish in the third party software ecosystem around Macs. Then I was just glad to have a slick GUI with actual Unix underpinnings. For reference, this happened in the time span from OS X 10.5 Leopard until 10.7 Lion. However, in that same time frame, I also noticed a gradual increase in problems. The computer seems to crash slightly more often, programs seemed to become more buggy, behavior less logical. At first, I marked this up as mostly a matter of my own increasing knowledge of the system, but as time went on, I became more and more convinced that it was actually the system getting worse, not myself becoming more sensitive.</p>

<p>So here are some of those problems:</p>

<h3>Lack of Uninstallers</h3>

<p>Computer people like to try new software. Some new software is crap. You should delete crap from your computer. Amazingly however, the Mac does not have any way of uninstalling some software.</p>

<p>At the moment, there are three ways of getting software on your Mac.</p>

<ol>
<li>Install from the App Store. Installation and un-installation work through the App Store.</li>
<li>Install by dragging n <code>*.app</code> bundle onto your computer. Uninstall by deleting the bundle. Works fine unless the app installed some stuff outside the bundle.</li>
<li>Install by executing a <code>*.pkg</code> file. No way to uninstall whatsoever unless the developer provides a separate uninstall mechanism.</li>
</ol>

<p>Really, this is beyond ridiculous. There is no way of uninstalling software that has been installed from a <code>*.pkg</code>. How the heck am I supposed to use my computer without uninstalling software? Seriously, Apple? Is this a joke?</p>

<p>(So as a rule, I will only install <code>*.pkg</code>s if there is absolutely no other way. Most of the time, I use or abuse <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/" >homebrew</a> to mitigate this problem.)</p>

<h3>Failing Time Machine</h3>

<p>So the Mac comes with this awesome backup solution called Time Machine. Just plug in your external hard drive, and it will magically keep all your data save, at all times. Better yet, buy a Time Capsule and this will happen over the wireless network so you don't even need to plug in that hard drive any more. Magic!</p>

<p>Except, every few weeks the Time Machine icon in the menu bar will have a small exclamation point, which indicates that something went wrong. Usually, it means that Time Machine somehow lost track of what it was doing and silently corrupted all backups beyond repair. This happens across several computers and Time Machines. The only solution is to delete all backups and start anew.</p>

<p>So, backups that are not backing up. How amazing is that?</p>

<h3>Living in the Cloud</h3>

<p>OS X is this astonishingly modern operating system, where all your email, contacts, calendars and settings are synced in the cloud, accessible from anywhere and any device or service you use. In theory.</p>

<p>Synchronization is cool. I used to live within the Googleverse, and all my contacts, calendars and email accounts would sync through Google to all my Apple devices. Life was good! Until things started to go bad. At some point, Mail.app lost an email or two. Not a big deal. Then iCal would not connect any more, and would need to be restarted every other day. And finally, Address Book deleted all my contacts from Google. Actually, it did not delete the whole contacts, just all the information inside them, and leave empty husks with only a name and maybe a partial email address.</p>

<p>I wish I was making this up. I tested this quite thoroughly. Whenever Contacts was set up to sync with Google, after a few days or weeks it would delete all my contacts. Of course, this being cloud backed, it would delete them everywhere on all my devices, without any backup or anything. Thankfully, Address Book on iOS seems to not have this problem.</p>

<p>Things can go wrong, I understand that. But deleting all my contacts? Not cool. Not. Cool.</p>

<h3>iPhoto</h3>

<p>My grandfather has this G4 PowerBook. He stores all his photos on it. So at one point, we just could not stand it any more to support his software problems and set him up with a newer MacBook (2007) just so we could at least roughly recreate his problems on our machines.</p>

<p>But to do that, we had to convert his old library from iPhoto 1876 to iPhoto 2008. iPhoto itself claims to be able to do that, and lo and behold, it magically imported the old library, started an update program, then another, then another, then another, then another, and updated the old library through the ages up to the most recent version. And everything seemed to work fine, all the albums were there, all the thumbnails looked right, just perfect. Except if you opened any image, it would only show black. I mean, I can understand that an import of a library that old does not work. But at least tell me so. Don't silently corrupt everything!</p>

<p>And then there was my own library, started in late 2007 and handed through different revisions of iPhoto to today. It countains about 25 Gb worth of photos. Funny enough, its size on disk is actually 65 Gb. What. The. Heck?</p>

<p>At this point, a giant <em>thank you</em> to the <a href="http://www.fatcatsoftware.com/iplm/" >iPhoto Library Manager</a> by Fat Cat Software, which saved both my library and my sanity! Those guys rock!</p>

<h3>OS X Lion with Auto Save and Versions</h3>

<p>The newest and brightest  in the land of Apple is OS X 10.7 Lion (at the time of writing). This amazing piece of software has a life-changing new feature: It friggin breaks one of the oldest tradition in computer history: Saving files.</p>

<p>Now normally, I would applaud this. Just save everything automatically and give me a sensible undo mechanism instead. Great!</p>

<p>However, in a stroke of genius, they also got rid of the possibility of <em>save as...</em>, which is just an easy way of duplicating a document. Say, because you received it in an email and want to file it somewhere else on your hard drive. Or because the document is saved on a thumb drive and you want to copy it over to your hard drive. No sir, you have to navigate to the document in the finder and copy it by hand from there. Thank you for your patience.</p>

<p>But the worst offender is Preview. Every program on the Mac has this very handy <em>proxy icon</em> in the window title. Whenever a window is representing a file on your computer, it will show that very file in the title, so you can drag and drop it somewhere else. Except preview won't give you the actual document. Instead, it will give you an alias to that document. Which is worth <em>nothing at all</em> if you drag it into an email, your Dropbox or a thumb drive.</p>

<p>Or try to enable File sharing on your local network, which works <em>sometimes</em>, but not all the time. Or Internet Sharing, which might share your internet connection, or break your DNS settings. Or take Bluetooth, which for the life of me, I can not make work for tethering with my iPhone, even though the same works just fine with the iPad and other Macs. Or take networking in general, which every once in a while just completely breaks down on my company's network and just refuses to send or receive any data over the Ethernet cable until I reboot my computer.</p>

<p>I could go on. Let's just say that Lion increased my WTF-per-minute rate significantly.</p>

<h3>Performance, Memory and File System</h3>

<p>Lets talk performance. I can't really complain here. In my MacBook Pro I have four cores, eight Gb of memory and a fast, Apple-sanctioned SSD. Life is good. Except that I happen to use virtual machines a whole lot and regardless of whether I use Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSuse) or Windows (7, 8) on there, they feel faster.</p>

<p>I mean, you don't feel the pain of starting applications much on OS X, because in general, you simply keep your programs running all the time. But even so, Firefox starts up on Windows in, like, no time at all, but takes noticeable time on OS X (same configuration and plugins). I have an SSD, so I mostly don't care, but still.</p>

<p>Or take boot times. Even in a virtual machine, both Windows 7 and 8 and Ubuntu 12.04 and Fedora 17 boot up in less than half a minute. In comparison, OS X Lion takes significantly longer, sometimes minutes. Again, you usually don't feel that pain too much because you don't reboot your Mac all that often (unless you run Bootcamp for gaming regularly). Still, OS X boot and shutdown times are downright shameful these days.</p>

<p>Lets run a few virtual machines. I have eight Gb of memory. Lets boot up a Windows VM and give it two Gb. Do anything you want, run Eclipse <em>and</em> Visual Studio <em>and</em> Firefox with loads of tabs <em>and</em> Steam. Windows will do just fine. Those two Gb are plenty for anything except gaming and photo/video editing. Do the same thing with Linux, same result. In fact, Linux will work just fine with even less memory. But OS X? Don't even <em>think</em> of running it with less than two Gb. Four Gb will give you a workable system if you don't run too many memory intensive applications. But start up XCode and Eclipse and you are done for. This is a huge waste.</p>

<p>And lastly, let's talk HFS+. Did you know that HFS+ has a global lock that prevents any program from accessing the hard drive while another program is doing so? That explains why OS X is so friggin slow on non-SSD drives. And did you ever notice that HFS+ is slowly corrupting your data, even if there are no power failures or anything? I fire up Disk Utility every so often and it will always find some file system corruptions. It rarely breaks stuff, but really, the file system is the very last part of my system I want to see failing randomly.</p>

<h3>So, what now?</h3>

<p>With all this love, why am I still using a Mac? Well, for one thing, the hardware is seriously great. I would love to see some laptop manufacturer build something equally sturdy, light and good looking as a MacBook Pro. I would love to see someone build a great touch pad into a non-Apple device. I would love to see Retina displays everywhere<a href="As" >^sight</a>. But I don't.</p>

<p>a matter of fact, I would love to see well enough to see Retina at all, but that is beside the point</p>

<p>And then there is software. Where is <a href="http://www.git-tower.com/" >Tower</a> for Windows or Linux? Or <a href="http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/" >Sparrow</a> or <a href="http://tapbots.com/blog/tweetbot/tweetbot-for-mac" >Tweetbot</a> or <a href="http://reederapp.com/mac/" >Reeder</a> or <a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/" >Pixelmator</a> or iPhoto? I'm not saying there are no alternatives, but I certainly have not been able to find any that were really up to the same level of polish.</p>

<p>That said, I have recently been playing around with Windows 8, Ubuntu 12.04 and Fedora 17 and I must say, I am quite taken with them. All of them. As for the next computer I am going to buy, I am doubtful if it will be an Apple computer again.</p>

<p>For a while now, I have been moving more and more services I use off Google. The reasons for that are manyfold, and few of them have anything to do with Google being evil or not--just to get that out of the way.</p>

<p>One of the last holdouts has been <a href="http://daskrachen.com" >my neglected Blogspot blog</a>. And one of the reasons for it being neglected is that it was hosted on Blogspot. Now don't get me wrong here, Blogspot is a terriffic blogging platform. You have this very nice nearly-WYSIWYG text editor right in your browser, you can upload images, you can publish instantly to your blog... Basically everything is taken care of for you conveniently right there in your browser. Google Style.</p>

<p>Its just that I don't like to work that way. I like plain text. I like typing stuff into a plain text editor. I like to be in control. And Blogspot might be convenient, but it did not make me feel like I was in control. In fact, I lost at least one article to Blogspot for unknown reasons.</p>

<p>Enter static site generators. The idea is that instead of writing rich text into some website, you create you content however you want on your own computer, then use a static generator which converts it into a set of static HTML pages and upload those to your website. Now all of the creation process is happening on your computer. You are in control. Probably the most popular program to do that is <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" >Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>The second part of the equation is some kind of publishing platform. With these static site generators, really any web server does that trick. Just push your generated HTML files to the server and be done with it. Even cooler is Github. Using <a href="http://pages.github.com/" >Github pages</a>, you can use your existing Github account and infrastructure to publish your blog just by pushing the HTML to Github. This is seriously cool!</p>

<p>So, I set out and tried <a href="http://octopress.org/" >Octopress</a>, which combines these two things into a nice blogging platform. Honestly though, I don't know much Ruby and all that <code>rake</code> workflow did not make me much more comfortable than pushing stuff into Blogspot.</p>

<p>Hence, I looked for alternatives. What I ended up with is <a href="http://pelican.notmyidea.org/" >Pelican</a>, a very simple static site generator written in Python. Finally, this is a codebase that is easy enough for me to understand and modify. If there is any trouble with my blog, I will be (and have been) able to just look at the source code and figure out what is going wrong. I like this!</p>

<p>To publish a new blog post, I will start by writing the post in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" >Markdown</a> (a format I understand), process it using the very simple command line <code>pelican -s my_config_file.py posts/</code>, and push the result to GitHub. Easy as pie. And I feel like I am in control again!</p>

<p>Actually, if this is just a bit too technical for you, check out <a href="http://calepin.co/" >Calepin</a> instead. It uses the very same Pelican engine, but instead of fiddling with Git, you just put your markdown files into your Dropbox, and--poof--you magically have a Blog!</p>

<p>If you want to see my blog as a repo on Github, just <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/bastibe.github.com/" >go have a look</a> (the <code>master</code> branch contains the HTML, the <code>source</code> branch contains the configuration and Markdown).</p>
