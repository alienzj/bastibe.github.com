<p>I am a mostly self-taught programmer. Apart from a few programming side jobs at the university, I have been programming professionally for the last two and a half years.</p>

<p>About two years ago, we wanted to buy a Matlab license for our company. However, our investors declined for dubious reasons. So I started looking for alternatives. Inspired by a good friend (thank you, Marc), I looked into Python. Python has this brilliant environment for <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/" title="NumPy">numerical</a> <a href="http://scipy.org/" title="SciPy">computation</a> and <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/" title="matplotlib">plotting</a> that, for my particular purposes, rivals Matlab.</p>

<p>However, just like Matlab, Python lacked a way of playing real time audio out of the box. At the university, we used <a href="http://playrec.co.uk/" title="Playrec">Playrec</a> for that purpose, which implements <a href="http://www.portaudio.com/" title="PortAudio">PortAudio</a> bindings for Matlab. Luckily, there was a similar package available for Python, called <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/" title="PyAudio">PyAudio</a>.</p>

<p>But, it had one crucial flaw: it only implemented blocking-mode audio I/O, so not much luck for my real time requirements. (Blocking mode means that whenever you want to play some audio, you have to wait until the piece of audio finishes playing before you can begin to play the next piece or do some computation. Clearly, you can not process audio while it is playing with such a scheme). After a lot of research, I figured that my best bet would be to dive in and add non blocking I/O to PyAudio.</p>

<p>At the time, I knew nothing of the Python C API (or Python, really), so those first attempts were riddled with subtle bugs and memory leaks. Nevertheless, it got the job done. I could play back audio in real time using Python!</p>

<p>This was a revelation to me: I could not only <em>use</em> a piece of software, I could also <em>change</em> it and mold it to my special needs!</p>

<p>Thus, I put up my changes on <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/PyAudio" title="PyAudio on github">github</a> and emailed the PyAudio maintainer. While the maintainer at the time did not have the time to incorporate my changes into the official PyAudio distribution, a few people discovered my version of it on github and contributed to it!</p>

<p>This, again, was a revelation to me: Not only could <em>I</em> change stuff other people did, wonderful people from around the world could collaborate and help each other. It always gave me a warm feeling of appreciation when some stranger on the internet chose to work with me!</p>

<p>Then, finally, I decided to take the plunge to Python 3. The main obstacle for this was that PyAudio did not support Python 3. So, again, I dove in and figured out how to make it compatible with Python 3. Again, I put the changes up on github and emailed the official PyAudio maintainer. This time, he took immediate notice and we started working on an official release of PyAudio including Python 3 support and non-blocking I/O.</p>

<p>And during those weeks, I had my third, and biggest, revelation about Open Source Software: The PyAudio maintainer is a brilliant mind, and I was humbled to find that I could learn a lot from this man.</p>

<p><em>By working on Open Source Software, you can work with really smart people, and learn from them. And the fruits of that labor can serve as instructions to yet more people to learn from.</em></p>

<p>I ran into this error twice now and wasted an hour both times, so it is time to put this on my universal scratchpad, i.e. this blog.</p>

<p>If you ever get this error when using <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/" >epydoc</a>:</p>

<pre><code>UNEXPECTED ERROR:
'Text' object has no attribute 'data'
</code></pre>

<p>You are probably running a version of Python that is greater than the latest one that is supported by epydoc. This is because epydoc has not been updated since 2008 and Python 2.5.</p>

<p>Luckily, some <a href="http://www.agapow.net/programming/python/epydoc-go-boom" >fine</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6704770/epydoc-attributeerror-text-object-has-no-attribute-data" >folks</a> on the internet have figured out how to fix these things.</p>

<p>Short answer: Find your <em>site-packages</em> directory:</p>

<pre><code><span class="code">    <span class="symbol">from</span> distutils.sysconfig <span class="symbol">import</span> get_python_lib
    <span class="symbol">print</span><span class="paren1">(<span class="code">get_python_lib<span class="paren2">(<span class="code"></span>)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>

<p>Go there, navigate to the <em>epydoc/markup</em> directory and change line 307 of the file <em>restructuredtext.py</em> from</p>

<pre><code><span class="code">    m = self._SUMMARY_RE.match<span class="paren1">(<span class="code">child.data</span>)</span></span></code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code><span class="code">    try:
        m = self._SUMMARY_RE.match<span class="paren1">(<span class="code">child.data</span>)</span>
    <span class="symbol">except</span> AttributeError:
        m = None</span></code></pre>

<p>This should fix that problem.</p>
</div> <hr> </div><div class="article-meta"> <a class="article-title" href="http://bastibe.de/posts/Using-a-Raspberry-Pi-as-a-Time-Capsule-for-Mountain-Lion.html">Using a Raspberry Pi as a Time Capsule for Mountain Lion</a> <div class="date"> posted on 2012-07-29 21:18</div> <div class="article">

<p>A while ago, I bought a Time Capsule to take care of my backups. I can't say it has been smooth sailing. Every now and then, the Time Capsule would claim that the backup did fail. Sometimes a reboot would help, sometimes not. Sometimes <code>hdiutil</code> would be able to salvage the backups, sometimes not. Sometimes, the backup disk image would simply be corrupted and the only option would be to delete it and start over.</p>

<p>This might be bad luck or it might be due to a defective Time Capsule or it might be due to my computer. I have no idea. But the thing is, if I have to hack on my backup system anyway, lets do it in style, at least. So here goes:</p>

<h3>Ingredients: <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" >A Raspberry Pi</a>, an external hard drive, some patience</h3>

<p>Format an SD card as described <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup" >in the wiki</a>. I just installed the version of Debian that is provided on <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads" >the official website</a>. Now just boot up.</p>

<p>Next, I was stumped because I only have an Apple LED display and no convenient way of connecting the Raspberry Pi's HDMI output to the LED display's Mini Display Port. After some searching and a combination of three adapter cables, I finally got it connected and could see it boot. Really, I have no use whatsoever for the HDMI port on the Raspberry pi. So the first thing I did was to enable SSH, which luckily is available right there in the configuration utility that starts when you boot the thing for the first time.</p>

<p>After that, I disconnected the display and immediately was stumped because I now had no way of finding the Pi's IP address. Actually, I did not even have a network to connect it to. So I strung an ethernet cable from my laptop to the Pi and enabled <em>Internet Sharing</em> in order to (1) start the DHCP server and (2) give the Pi internet access. The IP address was then easily found using <code>arp -a</code>.</p>

<h3>Setting up the hard drive</h3>

<p>First off, I needed to format and mount my external hard drive to be usable as a Time Machine volume. <code>ls /dev</code> showed the hard drive as <code>/dev/sda</code>. Thus, I installed <code>parted</code> using <code>sudo apt-get install parted</code> and used it <code>sudo parted</code>. In parted, <code>select /dev/sda</code> sets it up to modify the external hard drive, <code>rm 1</code> deleted its main partition, <code>q</code> to quit parted. Next, creating a new partition: <code>sudo fdisk</code>, then in there <code>n</code> with <code>p</code> and <code>1</code> to create a new primary partition, then <code>w</code> to apply the changes and exit. Lastly, I created the file system with <code>sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda1</code> with the whole partition as its size. Now lastly, I created a mount point for it using <code>mkdir ~/TimeMachine</code> (don't use <code>sudo</code>!) and auto-mounted it by appending this to <em>/etc/fstab</em></p>

<pre><code>/dev/sda1 /home/pi/TimeMachine ext4 rw,auto,user,exec,sync 0 0
</code></pre>

<p>Note: <code>sync</code> specifies that all file system changes have to be written to disk immediately, without caching. This might be bad for performance, but on the other hand, this behavior is probably a good idea for a backup system. I once read something somewhere that Apple is enforcing a similar behavior on their Time Capsules and that this is the reason why they won't allow any other network drive as Time Capsules.</p>

<h3>Setting up the shared folder</h3>

<p>First up, this requires <code>netatalk</code>, so I did <code>sudo apt-get update</code> and <code>sudo apt-get install netatalk</code> to install it. Next, netatalk has to be configured to actually share the drive on the network. This is accomplished by appending this line to <em>/etc/netatalk/AppleVolumes.default</em>:</p>

<pre><code>/home/pi/TimeMachine TimeMachine allow:pi cnidscheme:dbd options:upriv,usedot,tm
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the afp daemon should be configured to use the proper authentification schemes. Thus, add this to <em>/etc/netatalk/afpd.conf</em>:</p>

<pre><code>- -transall -uamlist uams_randnum.so,uams_dhx.so,uams_dhx2.so -nosavepassword -advertise_ssh
</code></pre>

<p>(maybe append <code>mdns</code> to the hosts in <em>/etc/nsswitch.conf</em>? Probably not necessary.)</p>

<p>I am also not quite sure whether I actually had to create a new file <em>/etc/avahi/services/afpd.service</em> and write into it:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?&gt;&lt;!--*-nxml-*--&gt;
    &lt;!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd"&gt;
    &lt;service-group&gt;
        &lt;name replace-wildcards="yes"&gt;%h&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;service&gt;
            &lt;type&gt;_afpovertcp._tcp&lt;/type&gt;
            &lt;port&gt;548&lt;/port&gt;
        &lt;/service&gt;
        &lt;service&gt;
            &lt;type&gt;_device-info._tcp&lt;/type&gt;
            &lt;port&gt;0&lt;/port&gt;
            &lt;txt-record&gt;model=Xserve&lt;/txt-record&gt;
        &lt;/service&gt;
    &lt;/service-group&gt;</code></pre>

<p>And maybe, you have to create an empty file that signifies the drive as Time Machine compatible using <code>touch ~/TimeMachine/.com.apple.timemachine.supported</code>.</p>

<p>I certainly did all that, but I am not quite sure which of these steps were strictly necessary. If you know, please let me, too.</p>

<p>Anyway, with all that done, restart both the netatalk and the Bonjour daemon using <code>sudo /etc/init.d/netatalk restart</code> and <code>sudo /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon restart</code>n.</p>

<h3>Setting up the Time Machine</h3>

<p><strike>Now, back to the Mac. In order to make Time Machine accept the new network share, run</p>

<pre><code>defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1
</code></pre>

<p></strike>
<strong>Edit:</strong> Turns out, this setting is not necessary. OSX just picks the Raspberry Pi as a usable Time Machine drive by default.</p>

<p>Finally, the TimeMachine folder on the Raspberry Pi was available as one of the backup drives. Halleluja!</p>

<p>Now transfer speeds for the initial backup are not exactly what I would call fast, but this might not be the Pi's fault. For one thing, the Pi is reporting to only run at half load. For another thing, the external hard drive and its USB connection is probably not very speedy. And lastly, I seem to remember that initial backups always were slow. But really, only time will tell how well this thing can do the job of a Time Capsule.</p>

<p>Further testing shows that transfer speeds are very comparable to the Time Capsule. Thus, I declare this a raging success!</p>

<p>I bought my first Apple computer in 2007 after a long time of gaming on Windows and a few years of Linux. In the beginning, I was just amazed at the consistency, practicality and sanity of the whole experience. I think I had a bad case of tinkeritis and neophilia in my Linux days, so this was probably to be expected.</p>

<p>Later, I marveled at the level of polish in the third party software ecosystem around Macs. Then I was just glad to have a slick GUI with actual Unix underpinnings. For reference, this happened in the time span from OS X 10.5 Leopard until 10.7 Lion. However, in that same time frame, I also noticed a gradual increase in problems. The computer seems to crash slightly more often, programs seemed to become more buggy, behavior less logical. At first, I marked this up as mostly a matter of my own increasing knowledge of the system, but as time went on, I became more and more convinced that it was actually the system getting worse, not myself becoming more sensitive.</p>

<p>So here are some of those problems:</p>

<h3>Lack of Uninstallers</h3>

<p>Computer people like to try new software. Some new software is crap. You should delete crap from your computer. Amazingly however, the Mac does not have any way of uninstalling some software.</p>

<p>At the moment, there are three ways of getting software on your Mac.</p>

<ol>
<li>Install from the App Store. Installation and un-installation work through the App Store.</li>
<li>Install by dragging n <code>*.app</code> bundle onto your computer. Uninstall by deleting the bundle. Works fine unless the app installed some stuff outside the bundle.</li>
<li>Install by executing a <code>*.pkg</code> file. No way to uninstall whatsoever unless the developer provides a separate uninstall mechanism.</li>
</ol>

<p>Really, this is beyond ridiculous. There is no way of uninstalling software that has been installed from a <code>*.pkg</code>. How the heck am I supposed to use my computer without uninstalling software? Seriously, Apple? Is this a joke?</p>

<p>(So as a rule, I will only install <code>*.pkg</code>s if there is absolutely no other way. Most of the time, I use or abuse <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/" >homebrew</a> to mitigate this problem.)</p>

<h3>Failing Time Machine</h3>

<p>So the Mac comes with this awesome backup solution called Time Machine. Just plug in your external hard drive, and it will magically keep all your data save, at all times. Better yet, buy a Time Capsule and this will happen over the wireless network so you don't even need to plug in that hard drive any more. Magic!</p>

<p>Except, every few weeks the Time Machine icon in the menu bar will have a small exclamation point, which indicates that something went wrong. Usually, it means that Time Machine somehow lost track of what it was doing and silently corrupted all backups beyond repair. This happens across several computers and Time Machines. The only solution is to delete all backups and start anew.</p>

<p>So, backups that are not backing up. How amazing is that?</p>

<h3>Living in the Cloud</h3>

<p>OS X is this astonishingly modern operating system, where all your email, contacts, calendars and settings are synced in the cloud, accessible from anywhere and any device or service you use. In theory.</p>

<p>Synchronization is cool. I used to live within the Googleverse, and all my contacts, calendars and email accounts would sync through Google to all my Apple devices. Life was good! Until things started to go bad. At some point, Mail.app lost an email or two. Not a big deal. Then iCal would not connect any more, and would need to be restarted every other day. And finally, Address Book deleted all my contacts from Google. Actually, it did not delete the whole contacts, just all the information inside them, and leave empty husks with only a name and maybe a partial email address.</p>

<p>I wish I was making this up. I tested this quite thoroughly. Whenever Contacts was set up to sync with Google, after a few days or weeks it would delete all my contacts. Of course, this being cloud backed, it would delete them everywhere on all my devices, without any backup or anything. Thankfully, Address Book on iOS seems to not have this problem.</p>

<p>Things can go wrong, I understand that. But deleting all my contacts? Not cool. Not. Cool.</p>

<h3>iPhoto</h3>

<p>My grandfather has this G4 PowerBook. He stores all his photos on it. So at one point, we just could not stand it any more to support his software problems and set him up with a newer MacBook (2007) just so we could at least roughly recreate his problems on our machines.</p>

<p>But to do that, we had to convert his old library from iPhoto 1876 to iPhoto 2008. iPhoto itself claims to be able to do that, and lo and behold, it magically imported the old library, started an update program, then another, then another, then another, then another, and updated the old library through the ages up to the most recent version. And everything seemed to work fine, all the albums were there, all the thumbnails looked right, just perfect. Except if you opened any image, it would only show black. I mean, I can understand that an import of a library that old does not work. But at least tell me so. Don't silently corrupt everything!</p>

<p>And then there was my own library, started in late 2007 and handed through different revisions of iPhoto to today. It countains about 25 Gb worth of photos. Funny enough, its size on disk is actually 65 Gb. What. The. Heck?</p>

<p>At this point, a giant <em>thank you</em> to the <a href="http://www.fatcatsoftware.com/iplm/" >iPhoto Library Manager</a> by Fat Cat Software, which saved both my library and my sanity! Those guys rock!</p>

<h3>OS X Lion with Auto Save and Versions</h3>

<p>The newest and brightest  in the land of Apple is OS X 10.7 Lion (at the time of writing). This amazing piece of software has a life-changing new feature: It friggin breaks one of the oldest tradition in computer history: Saving files.</p>

<p>Now normally, I would applaud this. Just save everything automatically and give me a sensible undo mechanism instead. Great!</p>

<p>However, in a stroke of genius, they also got rid of the possibility of <em>save as...</em>, which is just an easy way of duplicating a document. Say, because you received it in an email and want to file it somewhere else on your hard drive. Or because the document is saved on a thumb drive and you want to copy it over to your hard drive. No sir, you have to navigate to the document in the finder and copy it by hand from there. Thank you for your patience.</p>

<p>But the worst offender is Preview. Every program on the Mac has this very handy <em>proxy icon</em> in the window title. Whenever a window is representing a file on your computer, it will show that very file in the title, so you can drag and drop it somewhere else. Except preview won't give you the actual document. Instead, it will give you an alias to that document. Which is worth <em>nothing at all</em> if you drag it into an email, your Dropbox or a thumb drive.</p>

<p>Or try to enable File sharing on your local network, which works <em>sometimes</em>, but not all the time. Or Internet Sharing, which might share your internet connection, or break your DNS settings. Or take Bluetooth, which for the life of me, I can not make work for tethering with my iPhone, even though the same works just fine with the iPad and other Macs. Or take networking in general, which every once in a while just completely breaks down on my company's network and just refuses to send or receive any data over the Ethernet cable until I reboot my computer.</p>

<p>I could go on. Let's just say that Lion increased my WTF-per-minute rate significantly.</p>

<h3>Performance, Memory and File System</h3>

<p>Lets talk performance. I can't really complain here. In my MacBook Pro I have four cores, eight Gb of memory and a fast, Apple-sanctioned SSD. Life is good. Except that I happen to use virtual machines a whole lot and regardless of whether I use Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSuse) or Windows (7, 8) on there, they feel faster.</p>

<p>I mean, you don't feel the pain of starting applications much on OS X, because in general, you simply keep your programs running all the time. But even so, Firefox starts up on Windows in, like, no time at all, but takes noticeable time on OS X (same configuration and plugins). I have an SSD, so I mostly don't care, but still.</p>

<p>Or take boot times. Even in a virtual machine, both Windows 7 and 8 and Ubuntu 12.04 and Fedora 17 boot up in less than half a minute. In comparison, OS X Lion takes significantly longer, sometimes minutes. Again, you usually don't feel that pain too much because you don't reboot your Mac all that often (unless you run Bootcamp for gaming regularly). Still, OS X boot and shutdown times are downright shameful these days.</p>

<p>Lets run a few virtual machines. I have eight Gb of memory. Lets boot up a Windows VM and give it two Gb. Do anything you want, run Eclipse <em>and</em> Visual Studio <em>and</em> Firefox with loads of tabs <em>and</em> Steam. Windows will do just fine. Those two Gb are plenty for anything except gaming and photo/video editing. Do the same thing with Linux, same result. In fact, Linux will work just fine with even less memory. But OS X? Don't even <em>think</em> of running it with less than two Gb. Four Gb will give you a workable system if you don't run too many memory intensive applications. But start up XCode and Eclipse and you are done for. This is a huge waste.</p>

<p>And lastly, let's talk HFS+. Did you know that HFS+ has a global lock that prevents any program from accessing the hard drive while another program is doing so? That explains why OS X is so friggin slow on non-SSD drives. And did you ever notice that HFS+ is slowly corrupting your data, even if there are no power failures or anything? I fire up Disk Utility every so often and it will always find some file system corruptions. It rarely breaks stuff, but really, the file system is the very last part of my system I want to see failing randomly.</p>

<h3>So, what now?</h3>

<p>With all this love, why am I still using a Mac? Well, for one thing, the hardware is seriously great. I would love to see some laptop manufacturer build something equally sturdy, light and good looking as a MacBook Pro. I would love to see someone build a great touch pad into a non-Apple device. I would love to see Retina displays everywhere<a href="As" >^sight</a>. But I don't.</p>

<p>a matter of fact, I would love to see well enough to see Retina at all, but that is beside the point</p>

<p>And then there is software. Where is <a href="http://www.git-tower.com/" >Tower</a> for Windows or Linux? Or <a href="http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/" >Sparrow</a> or <a href="http://tapbots.com/blog/tweetbot/tweetbot-for-mac" >Tweetbot</a> or <a href="http://reederapp.com/mac/" >Reeder</a> or <a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/" >Pixelmator</a> or iPhoto? I'm not saying there are no alternatives, but I certainly have not been able to find any that were really up to the same level of polish.</p>

<p>That said, I have recently been playing around with Windows 8, Ubuntu 12.04 and Fedora 17 and I must say, I am quite taken with them. All of them. As for the next computer I am going to buy, I am doubtful if it will be an Apple computer again.</p>

<p>For a while now, I have been moving more and more services I use off Google. The reasons for that are manyfold, and few of them have anything to do with Google being evil or not--just to get that out of the way.</p>

<p>One of the last holdouts has been <a href="http://daskrachen.com" >my neglected Blogspot blog</a>. And one of the reasons for it being neglected is that it was hosted on Blogspot. Now don't get me wrong here, Blogspot is a terriffic blogging platform. You have this very nice nearly-WYSIWYG text editor right in your browser, you can upload images, you can publish instantly to your blog... Basically everything is taken care of for you conveniently right there in your browser. Google Style.</p>

<p>Its just that I don't like to work that way. I like plain text. I like typing stuff into a plain text editor. I like to be in control. And Blogspot might be convenient, but it did not make me feel like I was in control. In fact, I lost at least one article to Blogspot for unknown reasons.</p>

<p>Enter static site generators. The idea is that instead of writing rich text into some website, you create you content however you want on your own computer, then use a static generator which converts it into a set of static HTML pages and upload those to your website. Now all of the creation process is happening on your computer. You are in control. Probably the most popular program to do that is <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" >Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>The second part of the equation is some kind of publishing platform. With these static site generators, really any web server does that trick. Just push your generated HTML files to the server and be done with it. Even cooler is Github. Using <a href="http://pages.github.com/" >Github pages</a>, you can use your existing Github account and infrastructure to publish your blog just by pushing the HTML to Github. This is seriously cool!</p>

<p>So, I set out and tried <a href="http://octopress.org/" >Octopress</a>, which combines these two things into a nice blogging platform. Honestly though, I don't know much Ruby and all that <code>rake</code> workflow did not make me much more comfortable than pushing stuff into Blogspot.</p>

<p>Hence, I looked for alternatives. What I ended up with is <a href="http://pelican.notmyidea.org/" >Pelican</a>, a very simple static site generator written in Python. Finally, this is a codebase that is easy enough for me to understand and modify. If there is any trouble with my blog, I will be (and have been) able to just look at the source code and figure out what is going wrong. I like this!</p>

<p>To publish a new blog post, I will start by writing the post in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" >Markdown</a> (a format I understand), process it using the very simple command line <code>pelican -s my_config_file.py posts/</code>, and push the result to GitHub. Easy as pie. And I feel like I am in control again!</p>

<p>Actually, if this is just a bit too technical for you, check out <a href="http://calepin.co/" >Calepin</a> instead. It uses the very same Pelican engine, but instead of fiddling with Git, you just put your markdown files into your Dropbox, and--poof--you magically have a Blog!</p>

<p>If you want to see my blog as a repo on Github, just <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/bastibe.github.com/" >go have a look</a> (the <code>master</code> branch contains the HTML, the <code>source</code> branch contains the configuration and Markdown).</p>

<p>If you want to use rlua, you need to have Lua installed. However, OSX does not come with Lua preinstalled, so you install it using</p>

<pre><code>brew install lua
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, would it be nice if everyone agreed on how to install stuff like this. Case in point, homebrew installs liblua (quite reasonable) in <code>/usr/local/lib/liblua.[5.1[.4]].dylib</code></p>

<p>rlua however expects it to be called <code>liblua5.1.dylib</code> (notice the missing <code>.</code>).</p>

<p>Similarly, the headers are installed plainly into <code>/usr/local/include</code>, whereas rlua expects them to be in a folder called <code>lua5.1</code>.</p>

<p>Hence, here is how you get rlua to install:</p>

<pre><code>ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/lua/5.1.4/lib/liblua.5.1.4.dylib /usr/local/lib/liblua5.1.dylib
ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/lua/5.1.4/include/ /usr/local/include/lua5.1
</code></pre>

<p>Not exactly a beautiful solution, but it works.</p>
</div> <hr> </div><div class="article-meta"> <a class="article-title" href="http://bastibe.de/posts/Text-Editors.html">Text Editors</a> <div class="date"> posted on 2012-02-03 18:22</div> <div class="article">

<p>As far as I can tell, there has been a resurgence of development in the landscape of text editors of late. Only a few years ago, the text editing scene one the Mac seemed to be dominated by</p>

<ul>
<li>Crazy unix farts using Vim or Emacs</li>
<li>BBEdit users</li>
<li>Textmate users</li>
</ul>

<p>During a very short period of time though, a raft of new text editors became available. Sublime Text in particular has been getting a lot of attention and rave reviews by many people. To me, this warrants another look at what these new (and old) text editors are offering.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.vim.org/" >Vim</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/vim.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/vim_small.png" alt="Vim" /></a></p>

<p>Vim is very old software. It is a more or less direct descendant of ed from the early 1970s. It grew up in text based terminals without any graphical windows or mouses. Hence, all of its functionality is really meant to be used from the keyboard only, even though mousing is supported these days.</p>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/vim_window.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/vim_window_small.png" alt="Vim Window" /></a></p>

<p>The terminal inheritance limits its graphical capabilities somewhat. There are no graphical drawers or animations or pixel-precise scrolling. Everything is displayed in terms of rectangular characters, hence scrolling can only ever scroll one line at a time and there are no graphical images anywhere. Since Vim predates graphical displays altogether, it does not adhere to its standards much. In fact, in its normal mode it won't even type out the characters you hit on your keyboard.</p>

<p>This is at really Vim's greatest strength and weakness: In its 'normal mode', all key presses are interpreted like keyboard shortcuts in other programs. And what shortcuts there are! Pretty much every key on the keyboard has some special function, most keys even serve multiple functions depending on what mode you are in at the moment. Thus it should come as no surprise that you can do anything with these shortcuts at astounding speed. Watching a seasoned Vimmer do his keyboard dance is something to behold. Moving the cursor is especially powerful. Usually, any place in the current file is reachable using just a few key strokes. But of course, you are not limited to just viewing one file at a time either: Vim supports arbitrary split views and can even be used for efficient diffing or merging. And when it comes to changing that text, Vim is no slouch, either. There are various registers for saving text or locations, there is an increadibly powerful macro system, amazing searching capabilities, command line integration, there are specialized functions for programming… Really, when it comes to pure text editing chops, nothing beats Vim.</p>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/vim_full_window.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/vim_full_window_small.png" alt="Typical Vim Window" /></a></p>

<p>Vim is also incredibly customizable. Of course, there is no graphical preferences windows to do the customization in. You customize Vim by editing simple text files. Vim even includes its very own scripting language, VimScript, to enable users to extend it. There is a huge wealth of plugins available. These range from file browsers to support for new languages, or even some limited integration with compilers or source control tools. However, VimScript is not exactly a very pleasant language to code in and Vim does not actually like to interface with external tools much. These two issues limit the scope of what is possible with Vim somewhat–deep compiler integration and graphical debugging are fiddly at best, so you will probably just keep a terminal open and do them there. That said, the plugin ecosystem for Vim is probably still leaps and bounds beyond what is possible with most other text editor out there, but it does not quite reach the same breadth or integration as some IDEs or Emacs do.
All that power comes at a price. Learning Vim is hard. If you start out with Vim, it will probably take at least a week or so until you can approach your old productivity again. Mastering Vim will take years. Even after months and months of diligent learning, you will find some new tricks and features to increase your speed.</p>

<p>At the end of the day though, Vim is an amazingly powerful tool, and it is certainly worth it to at least learn the basics of it. Actually, most people I know who tried it have actually stuck with it. Myself, I have some two years of Vimming under my belt, too, and it has proven to be a very important tool for me.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" >Emacs 24</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/emacs.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/emacs_small.png" alt="Emacs" /></a></p>

<p>The thing you have to realize about Emacs is that… Emacs is powerful. People have called it <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NealStephenson" >the thermonuclear text editor</a>, and for a reason. Emacs can edit text, of course, but that is really only the most mundane of its features. Really, Emacs is a little world of its own. You can read and write your mail from within Emacs, you can do spreadsheets, calendaring, it can host terminals, debuggers, compilers, there is Tetris, hell, it even includes its very own psychiatrist! Speaking off the record here, I have a suspicion that Emacs might achieve sentience pretty soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/emacs_window.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/emacs_window_small.png" alt="Emacs Window" /></a></p>

<p>Similar to Vim, Emacs is old software. It was invented in the late 1970s at MIT and has been growing ever since. Also like Vim, its terminal inheritance shows its teeth sometimes: mouseweel scrolling can be awkward, especially if you like your inertial scrolling, the menu bar seems to not get much love and keyboard shortcuts are not conformant with what you might be used to from other text editors. On the other hand, Emacs has some very modern features like mixing of proportional fonts and fixed-width fonts or inline image display.</p>

<p>The upside of being old is that Emacs is very mature software. There is a ginormous selection of extensions available for Emacs, most of it actually distributed right with Emacs itself and a lot of it is superbly documented. Besides that, there are <a href="http://tromey.com/elpa/" >several</a> <a href="http://marmalade-repo.org/" >integrated</a> <a href="http://elpa.gnu.org/" >repositories</a> for additional tools that can be downloaded and installed from the internet.</p>

<p>The real power of Emacs is in that it is really not so much a text editor but a virtual machine for a programming language called eLisp. Really anything that can possibly be written in Lisp and remotely involves text editing is possible and probably already available in Emacs. As such, Emacs probably has the most diverse feature set of any text editor out there. Most relevant to programmers will be debugger integration, automatic syntax and spell checking, powerful and context-aware autocompletion, refactoring capabilities and much much more. Emacs is the only program in this list which can actually be used as a full fledged IDE on its own.</p>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/emacs_full_window.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/emacs_full_window_small.png" alt="Typical Emacs Window" /></a></p>

<p>But Emacs is not limited to programming at all. As mentioned before, it includes an Email client, a great calendar with an agenda, several IM clients, RSS readers, an <a href="http://orgmode.org/" >astoundingly powerful outliner</a> and spreadsheet editor, it is frequently used for blogging, writing screen plays, books or really anything you can think of.</p>

<p>The only real downside to this is that Emacs is, well, old. There is great power there, but is is only accessible to those willing to learn the myriad key combinations to invoke it. Rellay, mastering Emacs is a task for years, not weeks. But of course, you are not forced to wield all the power Emacs has to offer at once. Getting up to speed with basic text editing in Emacs will only take a few minutes, and the built-in help system and tutorial will guide you further whenever you feel the need to explore.</p>

<p>I have been using Emacs for several months now and I am really enjoying it. It has a few shortcomings, but it is constantly being improved and getting more modern every day. I can see myself giving in to it and just live in Emacs all day long, but for now, I'm happy with it just being my primary text editor. However, I can't quite get beyond the fact that its pure text editing chops are nowhere near Vim. Then again, Emacs does <a href="http://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home" >support Vim key bindings</a>, so this might turn out not to bother me in the long run.</p>

<p>At any rate, I would recommend anyone to give Emacs a shot at least for a short while. The power of Emacs can be an exhilarating experience, really.</p>

<h3><a href="http://macromates.com/" >Textmate (2)</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/textmate.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/textmate_small.png" alt="Textmate" /></a></p>

<p>For the longest time, all GUI text editors could generally be classified as either Vim-based, Emacs-based or shortcut-based. The prevalent crop of shortcut-based GUI text editors mapped all its advanced functions to certain modifier-letter combinations and/or menu bar items.</p>

<p>When Textmate was introduced, it introduced a new concept: snippets. Snippets are short pieces of text which, upon activating a certain trigger, would expand to arbitraryly complex constructs.</p>

<p>Thus, to define a class in some programming language, you would type <code>class</code>, then hit TAB, and it would expand to a complete class declaration with constructor, destructor and documentation. Further yet, the class name would be highlighted immediately, so you could start editing it to your liking. These edits would even automatically percolate to all the relevant places in the class declaration and thus automatically change all scope declarations and the like.
Or, you could drag some image file into some LaTeX code and it would expand (dragging being the trigger here) to a whole <code>\begin{figure}</code> complete with <code>\caption</code>, <code>\label</code>, the correct path to the image and everything else you need.</p>

<p>This has proven to be such a popular feature that since Textmate's inception, implementations of snippets have been developed for pretty much every IDE or text editor out there.</p>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/textmate_window.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/textmate_window_small.png" alt="Textmate Window" /></a></p>

<p>Textmate also featured a very flexible and easily extensible regex based syntax parser, beautiful color schemes, a very elegant project management system and a vibrant community extending it in many directions. This was even more fascinating in that most of this functionality was implemented using a convenient shell scripting engine that could utilize any programming language your shell supported.</p>

<p>Sadly though, its main developer got stuck somewhere along the way and development all but dried up for five years. This primarily meant that some issues just would not be fixed and thus, got all the more jarring. Most prominently, Textmate lacked split views, regex incremental search and would only do single character undo/redos. Many people left Textmate because of this lack of progress.</p>

<p>While I was in college, I used Textmate extensively and it proved to be a veritable tool for many editing tasks. It is somewhat limited in its integration with programming tools, though, so don't expect any complex compiler or debugger integration. Ultimately, I left it behind for lack of cross platform compatibility and lack of development. There used to be a Windows program called <a href="http://e-texteditor.com/" >E Text Editor</a>, which wanted to become a fully compatible Textmate alternative for Windows and Linux, but development never even reached production quality.</p>

<p>Recently however, an early alpha version of Textmate 2 has been released that could reinvigorate the community and fix long standing issues. Whether that will actually happen will remain to be seen.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.vicoapp.com/" >Vico</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/vico.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/vico_small.png" alt="Vico" /></a></p>

<p>Vico is a very new application that has spung to live only in 2011 and is not finished yet. It aims to be a modern Vim, combining the virtue of the powerful mode-based editing system of Vim with a modern Cocoa interface. It even merges Vim's editing capabilities with Textmate-derived snippets and syntax highlighting.</p>

<p>Really, it tries to be an organic symbiosis of Vim and Textmate. And for most purposes, it very much succeeds in this. Syntax highlighting is very solid, there is a code browser, a nice file browser and full support for Textmate snippets. Vico even includes a powerful scripting environment that enables you to extend it in a language called Nu, which has the interesting aspect of being able to call into every object or method in the Cocoa libraries, thus opening the doors to a boundless world of wonders. Its Vim integration is well on its way, too. The most notable omission at this point are macros. The developer is working on it though and has promised to implement them in the near future. Some other areas are lacking, too, but if development continues I see no reason why it should not become a very nice text editor.</p>

<p>As it stands though, development of Vico is going slow and its community is not very large yet. Vico is a very nice tool, but at the end of the day, I miss the raw power of an actual Vim just as I miss the vibrant community around Textmate. If you are not spoiled by Vim yet or find Vim just a bit too ugly for your taste, you could give Vico a try though.</p>

<p>Personally, I like it quite a bit and I am hoping very much that it will not be forgotten as a failed attempt to modernize Vim. That said, what with Sublime Text 2 including a limited support for Vim key bindings, I can't really see Vico taking off.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" >Sublime Text 2</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/sublimetext.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/sublimetext_small.png" alt="Sublime Text" /></a></p>

<p>Sublime Text is a fairly recent development. It is a one-man project that has gained a lot of enthusiastic following in the last few months. In many ways, it feels like the next step in text editor development. Much like several other text editors out there, it has adopted Textmate snippets, color themes and syntax definitions as its core feature set. On top of that though, it has built a very powerful and flexible extension system that really sets it apart.</p>

<p>Do you remember CMD-T from Textmate? To open some file, you would hit CMD-T and start typing a file name. The name would be fuzzy matched to select from all available files. Thus, typing <code>bcc</code> would select <code>BeaconController.cpp</code>. This form of selection is increadibly intuitive and fast. It is also the basis for the extension system of Sublime Text. If there is no keyboard shortcut for a command, hit CMD-Shift-P and start typing to invoke the command.</p>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/sublimetext_window.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/sublimetext_window_small.png" alt="Sublime Text Window" /></a></p>

<p>In very much the same way as M-x in Emacs (though with fuzzy matching), this can invoke arbitrarily complex commands such as <code>install bundle</code> or using some refactoring library. Additionally, the same mechanism can be used to jump to method names or opening files. Really, these features are very efficient implementations of a code browser and file browser.</p>

<p>The second big thing about Sublime Text is just the ridiculous amount of polish it received. For example, if you have two files with the same name, it will prefix the tab titles with the folder they reside in. Simple, but so useful! If you jump around in a file, there is always a subtle scrolling animation. Even simple text selections have slightly rounded borders and just look amazingly beautiful.</p>

<p>Also of note is that Sublime Text supports multiple cursors. Want to change then name of all occurrences of a variable? Just select them all (!) and change them all at once. This is another amazingly useful feature.
Its plugin system is based in Python, which is a refreshingly non-awkward choice for a text editor and spawned an astonishing amount of very interesting plugins already. Indeed the plugin system is flexible enough to support things like linters, source control integration and even something akin to Emacs's org-mode.
And it also supports <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html" >Vim key bindings</a>. Not very complete, but easily enough to be useful. Oh, and it is available cross-platform on Mac, Windows and Linux, too.</p>

<p>I think there are three big families of text editors: Emacs, Vim, and shortcut-based text editors. Since I discovered Textmate however, I started believing that it represents a new branch in the big tree of text editors. Sublime Text seems to be the next step in the evolution of the Textmate branch.</p>

<p>Really, Sublime Text is an amazing achievement. Maybe not quite as hackable as Emacs and not quite as flexible as Vim, but easily beating both in terms of elegance and modernity. If you don't want to learn Emacs or Vim, Sublime Text is what you should use. In fact, it is the first text editor ever that has tempted me to leave Emacs and Vim behind. Nuff said.</p>

<h3>What else is out there</h3>

<p>Of course, that little list up there is by no means complete. Neither does it list all the amazing features these text editors have to offer, nor does it represent an exhaustive list of them. To the best of my knowledge, this is a short list of other text editors for the Mac platform. Note however, that I have never used any of them extensively and can only tell you stuff from heresay.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html" >BBEdit</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/bbedit.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/bbedit_small.png" alt="BBEdit" /></a></p>

<p>BBEdit is the big daddy of Mac text editors. It is currently available in version 10 and has a huge follwing predominantly amongst web developers. As far as I can tell, it includes amazing features for editing HTML. Maybe amongst the best out there.
The remainder of its feature set seems rather standard crop though. There is some support for compilation, source code control, snippets, plugins… Though nothing on the level of Vim or Emacs really. Its most important disadvantage is probably its lack of cross-platform availability and extensibility.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/" >TextWrangler</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/textwrangler.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/textwrangler_small.png" alt="TextWrangler" /></a></p>

<p>TextWrangler is the free smaller brother of BBEdit. Its feature set is somewhat pared down in comparison with BBEdit. In particular, it is missing BBEdit's famous HTML magic and some advanced external tool integration.
Even for free, there are probably more capable candidates available, though maybe not at the same level of platform integration. That said, TextWrangler is not a bad choice and probably just fine for some casual text editing.</p>

<p>I really don't know much about JEdit other than that it is written in Java, it has a sizeable following and it is available cross-platform. It seems like it could be about as useful as any shortcut based text editor can ever be, which is no small achievement. Also, it features a rich plugin system, of which I only heard good things.
For all I know, this could be a very worthy alternative if you are on a budget (no Sublime Text) and don't want to learn Emacs or Vim.</p>

<h4><a href="http://chocolatapp.com/" >Chocolat</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/chocolat.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/chocolat_small.png" alt="Chocolat" /></a></p>

<p>Chocolat is yet another text editor that came into being in the post-Textmate void. It offers a good range of standard features, though notably missing advanced plugins apparently. Apart from that, it seems to be a solid shortcut based Mac text editor that is relatively cheap and actively developed.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.kodapp.com/" >Kod</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/kod.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/kod_small.png" alt="Kod" /></a></p>

<p>Kod started out as an open source alternative to Textmate. This is quite uncommon for a post-Textmate text editor and worth supporting. After a good start however, the developer found a new job and development has pretty much stalled.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit" >SubEthaEdit</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/subethaedit.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/subethaedit_small.png" alt="SubEthaEdit" /></a></p>

<p>The great thing about SubEthaEdit is collaborative editing. if you want to edit text collaboratively with several people, SubEthaEdit performs the task seamlessly and elegantly.
Beyond that, it is a capable shortcut-based text editor. If you don't need the collaboration feature, you should probably look elsewhere though.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.peterborgapps.com/smultron/" >Smultron</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/smultron.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/smultron_small.png" alt="Smultron" /></a></p>

<p>Another venerable veteran on the Mac, Smultron used to be a free open source text editor that had a sizeable following. However, the developer ceased development at some point and later restarted the effort as a paid app in the Mac App Store.
Smultron lost most of its following in that transition.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.slickedit.com/products/slickedit" >SlickEdit</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/slickedit.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/slickedit_small.png" alt="SlickEdit" /></a></p>

<p>SlickEdit is easily the most expensive text editor in this list. A single user license for one platform and one developer costs a scant 300 bucks. That is a lot of money for a text editor and is usually only shelled out only for business critical platform exclusive IDEs. It seems as if SlickEdit tries to be exactly that for general purpose text editing.
It's feature list reads very well and checks all mayor boxes. It is available on pretty much any platform out there and is probably only rivalled by Emacs or Vim in that regard. It also supports emulation for Emacs or Vim key bindings.
That said, 300-600 $ per developer is a pretty hefty price tag. Personally, I doubt that SlickEdit can live up to that price if you compare it to some of the other examples in this list. It is undoubtedly a well-maintained and powerful text editor though.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit" >Komodo Edit</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/komodo.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/komodo_small.png" alt="Komodo Edit" /></a></p>

<p>Komodo Edit is the free open source offspring of ActiveState's Komodo IDE. It's feature set is very complete and seems to be very worthy for many editing tasks. Being of IDE ancestry provides it with nice plugin support and very helpful deep language integration like sophisticated autocompletion and syntax checking.
There are also quite good Vim key bindings and it is available on the three major platforms. However, its language support is limited to Perl, Python, Tcl, PHP, Ruby and Javascript. Probably not a bad choice if you can live with the language selection and are on a budget.</p>

<h4>TextEdit</h4>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/textedit.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/textedit_small.png" alt="TextEdit" /></a></p>

<p>The built-in text editor in OSX. No syntax highlighting, project management or any programming support whatsoever make this a rather poor choice. There are plenty of free alternatives out there.
That said, TextEdit does support rich text editing and might be of value for the odd letter to your grandma.</p>

<h4>Text editors for web development</h4>

<p>Strangely, all the major Mac text editors that cater specifically for web development are not cross platform. If web development is all you are ever doing though, these text editors might be well worth their money.</p>

<h5><a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/" >Coda</a></h5>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/coda.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/coda_small.png" alt="Coda" /></a></p>

<p>Combine the SubEthaEdit text editing engine including its collaborative tools with the great FTP program Transmit and you have CODA, the program for &quot;one-window web development&quot;. It even includes a reference book to HTML in the package. For what it is, probably of great value and nice polish. As a general purpose text editor, there are better alternatives.</p>

<h5><a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/" >Espresso</a></h5>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/espresso.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/espresso_small.png" alt="Espresso" /></a></p>

<p>Another text editor gearing specifically for web development. Thus, you get powerful HTML and CSS editing features and good support for typical web development languages such as PHP, Ruby or Markdoen, but no support for other languages. There is an extension system though that could improve language support. This might be a slightly less expensive alternative to Coda.</p>

<h5><a href="http://tacosw.com/" >Taco HTML Editor</a></h5>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/taco.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/taco_small.png" alt="Taco HTML Editor" /></a></p>

<p>Another text editor geared exclusively towards web development. This time around though, there is no support for languages other than HTML, CSS and PHP, which makes this program a rather poor choice.</p>

<h5><a href="http://www.beforedawnsolutions.com/applications/skedit" >skEdit</a></h5>

<p><a href="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/skedit.png" ><img src="http://bastibe.de/static/2012-02/skedit_small.png" alt="skEdit" /></a></p>

<p>skEdit supports a nice array of web development languages and offers a good range of features for a web development text editor. Also, it is pretty inexpensive in comparison to its brethren here. Probably a nice choice for web development if you are on a budget.</p>
</div> <hr> </div><div class="article-meta"> <a class="article-title" href="http://bastibe.de/posts/How-to-make-Tagbar-work-with-Objective-C.html">How to make Tagbar work with Objective-C</a> <div class="date"> posted on 2011-12-04 20:21</div> <div class="article">

<p>For the longest time, ctags did not support Objective-C. Without tags, many of the cool programming-related features of Vim simply didn't work. (There are ways to coax other programs to output tags, but this is usually painful)</p>

<p>Recently however, ctags finally gained support for Objective-C! Hurrah!
As of today, Objective-C support is not in the stable branch yet, but thanks to the magic of homebrew, an Obj-C ready ctags is only a <code>brew install ctags --HEAD</code> away!</p>

<p>With that, tag navigation in Vim works for Objective-C. Awesome!
However, Tagbar does not work yet. There used to be <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/5790832/1034" >a workaround</a> that apparently worked for some people, but it did not work for me.
Things like this drive me nuts. I can see that tags are being generated, but Tagbar won't show them. What is going wrong?</p>

<p>Some investigation proved: There is simply no template in Tagbar for Objective-C! Luckily, that can be fixed quite easily: Simply put this code in your .vimrc:</p>

<pre><code>:::vimscript
&quot; add a definition for Objective-C to tagbar
let g:tagbar_type_objc = {
    \ 'ctagstype' : 'ObjectiveC',
    \ 'kinds'     : [
        \ 'i:interface',
        \ 'I:implementation',
        \ 'p:Protocol',
        \ 'm:Object_method',
        \ 'c:Class_method',
        \ 'v:Global_variable',
        \ 'F:Object field',
        \ 'f:function',
        \ 'p:property',
        \ 't:type_alias',
        \ 's:type_structure',
        \ 'e:enumeration',
        \ 'M:preprocessor_macro',
    \ ],
    \ 'sro'        : ' ',
    \ 'kind2scope' : {
        \ 'i' : 'interface',
        \ 'I' : 'implementation',
        \ 'p' : 'Protocol',
        \ 's' : 'type_structure',
        \ 'e' : 'enumeration'
    \ },
    \ 'scope2kind' : {
        \ 'interface'      : 'i',
        \ 'implementation' : 'I',
        \ 'Protocol'       : 'p',
        \ 'type_structure' : 's',
        \ 'enumeration'    : 'e'
    \ }
\ }
</code></pre>

<p>With that, Tagbar should work. Admittedly, it won't work perfectly yet. Class definitions will show up in addition to their contents and the contents of all categories will go into the same list. Also, you won't get much more than a flat list of functions with no way to distinguish between class methods and object methods. This can be confusing at times, but by and large, it does the job!</p>

<p>Happy Vimming!</p>

<p>Well, it's compile time again. Once again, I need to install scipy and matplotlib using homebrew and pip on Lion.<br/>
It seems things have improved since I tried to compile last time! Well, it still does not work out of the box, but at least now it can be done without compiling by hand:
(remember to brew install pkg-config and gfortran first)</p>

<p><code>pip install -e git+https://github.com/scipy/scipy#egg=scipy-dev</code><br/>
<code>pip install -e git+https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib#egg=matplotlib</code></p>

<p>I must say, this is still a mess. But at least, it is getting less bad.</p>
