<p>
Sometimes, you just have to use C code. There's no way around it. C is the lingua franca and bedrock of our computational world. Even in Matlab, sometimes, you just have to call into a C library.
</p>

<p>
So, you grab your towel, you bite the bullet, you strap into your K&amp;R, and get down to it: You start writing a Mex file. And you curse, and you cry, because writing C is hard, and Mex doesn't exactly make it any better. But you know what? <i>There is a better way!</i>
</p>

<p>
Because, unbeknownst to many, Matlab includes a Foreign Function Interface. The technique was probably pioneered by <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/">Common Lisp</a>, and has since <a href="http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html">been</a> <a href="http://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html">widely</a> <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/functions.html">adopted</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">everywhere</a>: calling functions in a C library without writing any C code and without invoking a compiler!
</p>

<p>
Mind you, there remains a large and essential impedance mismatch between C's statically typed calling conventions and the vagaries of a dynamically typed language such as Matlab, and even the nicest FFI can't completely hide that fact. But anything is better than the abomination that is Mex.
</p>

<p>
So here goes, a very simple C library that adds two arrays:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-C"><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">// </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">test.c:</span>
<span style="color: #111111;">#include</span> test.h

<span style="color: #111111; text-decoration: underline;">void</span> <span style="color: #111111; text-decoration: underline;">add_arrays</span>(<span style="color: #111111; text-decoration: underline;">float</span> *<span style="color: #111111;">out</span>, <span style="color: #111111; text-decoration: underline;">float</span>* <span style="color: #111111;">in</span>, <span style="color: #111111; text-decoration: underline;">size_t</span> <span style="color: #111111;">length</span>) {
    <span style="color: #111111; font-weight: bold;">for</span> (<span style="color: #111111; text-decoration: underline;">size_t</span> <span style="color: #111111;">n</span>=0; n&lt;length; n++) {
        out[n] += in[n];
    }
}

<span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">// </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">test.h:</span>
<span style="color: #111111;">#include</span> <span style="color: #303030;">&lt;stddef.h&gt;</span>
<span style="color: #111111; text-decoration: underline;">void</span> <span style="color: #111111; text-decoration: underline;">add_arrays</span>(<span style="color: #111111; text-decoration: underline;">float</span> *<span style="color: #111111;">out</span>, <span style="color: #111111; text-decoration: underline;">float</span> *<span style="color: #111111;">in</span>, <span style="color: #111111; text-decoration: underline;">size_t</span> <span style="color: #111111;">length</span>);
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Let's compile it! <code>gcc -shared -std=c99 -o test.so test.c</code> will do the trick.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's load that library into Matlab with <code>loadlibrary</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-octave"><span style="color: #111111; font-weight: bold;">if</span> not(libisloaded(<span style="color: #303030;">'test'</span>))
    [notfound<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> warnings] <span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">=</span> loadlibrary(<span style="color: #303030;">'test.so'</span><span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> <span style="color: #303030;">'test.h'</span>)<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">;</span>
    assert(isempty(notfound)<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> <span style="color: #303030;">'could not load test library'</span>)
<span style="color: #111111; font-weight: bold;">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that <code>loadlibrary</code> can't parse many things you would commonly find in header files, so you will likely have to strip them down to the bare essentials. Additionally, <code>loadlibrary</code> doesn't throw errors if it can't load a library, so we always have to check the <code>notfound</code> output argument to see if the library was actually loaded successfully.
</p>

<p>
With that, we can call functions in that library using <code>calllib</code>. But we can't just pass in Matlab vectors, that would be too easy. We first have to convert them to something C can understand: Pointers
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-octave">vector1 <span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">=</span> [1 2 3 4 5]<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">;</span>
vector2 <span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">=</span> [9 8 7 6 5]<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">;</span>

vector1ptr <span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">=</span> libpointer(<span style="color: #303030;">'singlePointer'</span><span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> vector1)<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">;</span>
vector2ptr <span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">=</span> libpointer(<span style="color: #303030;">'singlePointer'</span><span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> vector2)<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">;</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
What is nice about this is that this automatically converts the vectors from <code>double</code> to <code>float</code>. What is less nice is that it uses its weird <code>singlePtr</code> notation instead of the more canonical <code>float*</code> that you would expect from a self-respecting C header.
</p>

<p>
Then, finally, let's call our function:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-octave">calllib(<span style="color: #303030;">'test'</span><span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> <span style="color: #303030;">'add_arrays'</span><span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> vector1ptr<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> vector2ptr<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> length(vector1))<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">;</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you see no errors, everything went smoothly, and you will now have changed the content of vector1ptr, which we can have a look at like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-octave">added_vectors <span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">=</span> vector1ptr.Value<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">;</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that this didn't change the contents of <code>vector1</code>, only of the newly created pointer. So there will always be some memory overhead to this technique in comparison to Mex files. However, runtime overhead seems pretty fine:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-octave">timeit(@() calllib(<span style="color: #303030;">'test'</span><span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> <span style="color: #303030;">'add_arrays'</span><span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> vector1ptr<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> vector2ptr<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> length(vector1)))
<span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">%   </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">ans = 1.9155e-05</span>
timeit(@() the_same_thing_but_as_a_mex_file(single(vector1)<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> single(vector2)))
<span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">%   </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">ans = 4.6262e-05</span>
timeit(@() the_same_thing_plus_argument_conversion(vector1<span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">,</span> vector2))
<span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">%   </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">ans = 1.2326e-04</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So as you can see, the <code>calllib</code> is plenty fast. However, if you add the Matlab code for converting the double arrays to pointers and extracting the summed data afterwards, the FFI is noticeably slower than a Mex file.
</p>

<p>
However, If I ask myself whether I would sacrifice 0.00007 seconds of computational overhead for hours of my life <i>not</i> spent with Mex, there really is no competition. I will choose Matlab's FFI over writing Mex files every time.

<div class="post-date">30 May 2016</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="http://bastibe.de/2016-05-30-matplotlib-font-cache.html">Updating the Matplotlib Font Cache</a></h1>
<p>
When publishing papers or articles, I want my plots to integrate with the text surrounding them. I want them to use the correct font size, and the correct font.
</p>

<p>
This is easy to do with Matplotlib:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #111111; font-weight: bold;">import</span> matplotlib
<span style="color: #111111;">matplotlib.rcParams</span>[<span style="color: #303030;">'font.size'</span>] = 12
<span style="color: #111111;">matplotlib.rcParams</span>[<span style="color: #303030;">'font.family'</span>] = <span style="color: #303030;">'Calibri'</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
However, sometimes, Matplotlib won't find the correct, even though it is clearly installed. This happens when Matplotlib's internal font cache is out of date.
</p>

<p>
To refresh the font cache, use
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">matplotlib.font_manager._rebuild()
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Happy Plotting!
</p>
<div class="post-date">13 Mar 2016</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="http://bastibe.de/2016-03-13-code-quality-in-scientific-code.html">The Style of Scientific Code</a></h1>
<p>
What does quality code look like? One common school of thought focuses on small, descriptive functions that take few arguments. To quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin">Clean Code</a>: "The first rule of functions is that they should be small", on the order of less than ten lines. "Functions should not be large enough to hold nested structures". "The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero [, one, or two]. Three [or more] arguments should be avoided where possible".
</p>

<p>
A few years ago, when I was working mostly on user interaction and data management, all of this made sense to me. What is the overhead of a few function calls and class lookups here and there if it makes the code more readable? In other words: Readability counts, and is usually more important than performance.
</p>

<p>
But lately, I have come to struggle with these rules. I am now writing a lot of scientific code, where algorithms are intrinsically complex beyond the syntactic complexity of the code. How do you "Express yourself in code [instead of comments]", when that code only consists of linear algebra and matrix multiplications?
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #111111; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #111111; text-decoration: underline;">rectwin_spectrum</span>(angular_frequency, specsize):
    <span style="color: #303030;">"""The spectrum of a rectangular window. [...]"""</span>
    <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;"># </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">In case of angular_frequency == 0, this will calculate NaN. Since</span>
    <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;"># </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">this will be corrected later, suppress the warning.</span>
    <span style="color: #111111; font-weight: bold;">with</span> np.errstate(invalid=<span style="color: #303030;">'ignore'</span>):
        <span style="color: #111111;">spectrum</span> = ( np.exp(-1j*angular_frequency*(specsize-1)/2) *
                     np.sin(specsize*angular_frequency/2) /
                     np.sin(angular_frequency/2) )
    <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;"># </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">since sin(x) == x for small x, the above expression</span>
    <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;"># </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">evaluates to specsize for angular_frequency == 0.</span>
    <span style="color: #111111;">spectrum</span>[angular_frequency == 0.0] = specsize
    <span style="color: #111111; font-weight: bold;">return</span> spectrum
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A lot of my scientific code ends up quite compact like that. Maybe a hundred lines of dense numeric expressions, plus a few hundred lines of explanations and documentation. The point is, scientific code often does not decompose into easily understood extractable functions.
</p>

<p>
On a related issue, how do you avoid long argument lists in heavily parametrized equations? As Clean Code states, "when a function seems to need more than two or three arguments, it is likely that some of those arguments ought to be wrapped in a class of their own". However, in Matlab in particular, it is quite unusual to create small one-trick classes to encapsulate a few function arguments:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-octave"><span style="color: #111111; font-weight: bold;">classdef</span> SignalBlocks <span style="color: #111111; background-color: #fffff8;">&lt;</span> handle

</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is not just cumbersome to write and maintain, it is also slower than passing <code>data</code>, <code>samplerate</code>, <code>blocksize</code>, and <code>hopsize</code> to each function call individually (although the overhead has gotten considerably smaller in newer versions of Matlab). Additionally, there is often a large performance benefit of <i>not</i> extracting every function and <i>not</i> keeping intermediate values in variables. Thus, it's not just readability that is hard to maintain in scientific code. Performance is a problem, too.
</p>

<p>
The sad thing is, I don't know the answer to these questions. There have been a lot of discussions about coding style and code quality in our department lately, with the clear objective to clean up our code. But common code quality criteria don't seem to apply to scientific code all that well.
</p>

<p>
Do you have any idea how to progress from here?

<div class="post-date">23 Jan 2016</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="http://bastibe.de/2016-01-23-toren.html">Toren</a></h1>
<p>
I've been playing a lot of indie games lately. One of them has not been talked about much: <a href="http://toren-game.com/">Toren</a>. Toren is a platformer about a girl that has to climb a tower to defeat a dragon and revive her world. This is probably the least polished game I have played in a long time. Animations are janky, controls are imprecise and clunky, and there are loads of little glitches. Yet, I really enjoyed this.
</p>

<p>
There is something about this world that feels honest to me: As you climb the tower, the child grows from a toddler to an adolescent, and is gradually introduced to more and more mature concepts. I didn't understand much of the iconography of this game, but it felt oddly cathartic to climb this tower of life, and overcome it's challenges.
</p>

<p>
I particularly liked how death played such an integral role in this story and some of the puzzles. The tower is a monument to a dead people, and yet the story and game mechanics are as much about dying as they are about rebirth and not giving up. This is underlined by the wonderful art style of this game, which contrasts vivid colors with brooding, dark architecture.
</p>

<p>
At just about two hours, Toren is not a long game. Instead of exploring one particular game mechanic, it mixes it's game up every few minutes. Every sequence looks different and beautiful, and yet it manages to tell a cohesive and effective story. ★★★★☆

I don't usually enjoy fantasy novels and their romantic escapism. I much prefer fascinating sci-fi thought experiments. But this book won all the most important awards, so I gave it a shot. What if random chance could be bent a little with creativity, the power of believing in something, and some mysticism? You end up with a world that is richer, more meaningful, and altogether more alive, if you just cared to observe and to appreciate it's beauty. Reading this book left me enchanted and more observant long after I put it down. What a wonderful book!

This is one of those books that was on my to-read list for months. It starts out as quirky and likeable as you would expect from John Irving. This time, we follow the tale of a Canadian/Indian doctor throughout his life, and his summer vacation in India. But this would not be John Irving if there weren't plenty of colourful characters, astute observations of human strangeness, and a meticulously crafted story. There is no scene in this book that does not serve a purpose, and so many moving parts my mind just boggles at the construction of it all. Yet at the same time, I was regularly laughing out loud. I loved every minute of this!

The whole world changed in the near future, when gasoline is a rare luxury, sea levels have risen and swallowed all the coastal cities, and man-made scourges have devastated most crops. And now it's not just humans that populate our urbanized world, but so too are our inventions, artificial humans called "windups" for their stutter-stop movements. But at the core, both humans and windups struggle for the same security, prosperity as ever. Such an inventive world, so much vivid creativity, social commentary, in this human struggle to not destroy ourselves.

This is about equal parts a motorcycle journey of a father and his son across the US, and a dive into another man's discoveries of philosophy. To be honest, I liked this book more for it's character descriptions and travelling adventures than it's philosophy. I am really conflicted about putting this book on this list at all, but I kept thinking about this long after I finished reading it, so I guess this had a bigger influence on me than I realized.

What happens when you take today's world, and add nanotech brain upgrades (Nexus/Crux/Apex), or strand a lone scientist on Mars (The Martian), or send a large number of people to found a new colony on Mars (Red/Blue/Green Mars), or suddenly make contact with Aliens (The Three-Body Problem)? This what-if is what Science Fiction does best: Take this little what-if, and spin a gripping yarn from that. These books inspired me, made me think, were incredibly thrilling, but they did not have a lasting impact. Still well worth a read if you like Science Fiction, though.
