<p>
I recently released my first-ever piece of commercial software, a <a href="https://missiongenerator.eu/">plugin</a> for the <a href="https://www.x-plane.com/">X-Plane</a> flight simulator. I wrote this primarily to scratch my own itch, but thought other users might like it, too, so I put it up on <a href="https://store.x-plane.org/Mission-Generator_p_877.html">the store</a>. What struck me however, were the stark difference between the kinds of responses I got to this, as compared to my open source projects: They were astonishingly, resoundingly, <i>positive</i>!
</p>

<p>
You see, I have a bunch of open source projects, with a few thousand downloads per month, and a dozen or so issues on Github per week. Most of my interactions with my users are utilitarian, and efficient. Someone reports a bug or asks for help, I ask for clarification or a pull request, we iterate a few times until the issue is resolved. The process is mechanical and the tone of our conversation is equally unemotional. This is as it should be.
</p>

<p>
After having released my flight simulator plugin, however, people <i>thanked me</i>! They <i>congratulated me</i>! They extolled about the greatness of what I had built! And they did this despite the fact that the initial release had quite a few major bugs, and even flat-out did not work for some people. Yet even people who couldn't get it to work were <i>grateful</i> for my help in resolving their issue!
</p>

<p>
This <i>blew my mind</i>, in comparison with the drab "I found a bug", "Could you implement…" I was used to from my open source work. There, the feedback I got was mostly neutral (bug reports, feature requests), and sometimes even negative ("You broke something!"). So I release my software <i>for free</i>, as a gift, and get average-negative feedback. My commercial work, in contrast, <i>costs money</i>, and yet the feedback I get is resoundingly positive! I can not overstate how motivating it is to get praise, and love, from my users.
</p>

<p>
I think this is a huge problem for our Open Source community. I had my run-ins with burnout, when all the pull requests came to be too much, and I started dreading the little notification icon on Github. And I think the negativity inherent in bug reports and feature requests has a huge part to do with this. In the future, I will try to add more praise to my bug reports from now on, just to put things into perspective.
</p>

<p>
But I think we should go further than that. We should create tools for praising stuff, beyond the impersonal Stars on Github. We should be able to write reviews on Github, and recommendations, and blog posts about cool libraries we find.
</p>

<p>
I recently got my first github issue that was <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog/issues/12">just a thank-you note</a>. I loved it! We need more positivity like that.

<p>
<a href="https://bastibe.de/2018-04-02-scheduling-future-todos-in-org-journal.html">A month ago</a>, org-journal learned to deal with future journal entries. I use future journal entries for appointments or not-yet-actionable tasks that I don't want in my current TODO list just yet. This works really well while I am at my computer, and really does not work at all when I am not (<a href="http://www.orgzly.com/">Orgzly</a> does <i>not</i> work with my 1k-file journal directory).
</p>

<p>
But, as I keep re-discovering, org-mode already has a solution for this: org-mode can export your agenda to an iCalendar file! Most calendar applications can then subscribe to that file, and show your future journal entries right in your calendar. And if you set it up right, this will even sync changes to your calendar!
</p>

<p>
First, you need to set up some kind of regular export job. I use a cron job that regularly runs an Emacs batch job <code>emacs --batch --script ~/bin/calendar_init.el</code> with the following code in <i>calendar​_init.el</i>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp"><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">;; </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">no init file is loaded, so provide everything here:</span>
(add-to-list 'load-path <span style="color: #303030;">"~/etc/org-journal/"</span>)
(<span style="color: #111111; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> org-journal-dir <span style="color: #303030;">"~/journal/"</span>            <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">; </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">where my journal files are</span>
      org-journal-file-format <span style="color: #303030;">"%Y-%m-%d.org"</span>  <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">; </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">their file names</span>
      org-journal-enable-agenda-integration t <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">; </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">so entries are on the agenda</span>
      org-icalendar-store-UID t               <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">; </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">so changes sync correctly</span>
      org-icalendar-include-todo <span style="color: #303030;">"all"</span>        <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">; </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">include TODOs and DONEs</span>
      org-icalendar-combined-agenda-file <span style="color: #303030;">"~/calendar/org-journal.ics"</span>)

(<span style="color: #111111; font-weight: bold;">require</span> '<span style="color: #111111;">org-journal</span>)
(org-journal-update-org-agenda-files) <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">; </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">put future entries on the agenda</span>
(org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files)  <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">; </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">export the ICS file</span>
(save-buffers-kill-emacs t)           <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">; </span><span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">save all modified files and exit</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It is important to set <code>org-icalendar-store-UID</code>, as otherwise every change to a future entry would result in a duplicated calendar entry. It will clutter up your journal entries with an <code>UID</code> property, though.
</p>

<p>
I do this on my web server, with my journal files <a href="https://syncthing.net/">syncthing</a>ed from my other computers. With that, I can subscribe to the calendar file from any internet-connected computer or mobile phone (using <a href="https://icsdroid.bitfire.at/">ICSdroid</a>). But you could just as well sync only the ICS file, or just subscribe to the local file, if you don't want to upload your complete yournal to a web server.
</p>

<p>
(Incidentally, I first implemented my own ICS export, before realizing that this functionality already existed in org-mode. It was a fun little project, and I learned a lot about org-mode's internal data structures and the weirdness that are iCalendar files.)

<div class="post-date">25 May 2018</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="2018-05-25-gdpr-compliance.html">GDPR Compliance</a></h1>
<p>
Personal email is dead. The signal-to-noise ratio of my personal email account has been deeply negative for years. But the last few days have been especially riveting, with a torrent of GDPR-compliance emails from just about every company that has ever gotten their hands on my email address. Anecdotally, if spam makes up about 90% of all email traffic, and the last few days have seen a ten-fold increase in traffic due to GDPR emails, we might even have "defeated spam" for a few days! Yay internet!
</p>

<p>
But sadly, I can't add to the signal-to-noise ratio, because this website does not collect any email addresses. And even more sadly, it doesn't even collect IP addresses, or use any kind of analytics at all. Sorry about that. I honestly do not know how many people read my stuff, and I can not rank my blog posts by their popularity. And I like it that way. It prevents me from getting on any kind of treadmill to please any kind of imagined audience.
</p>

<p>
That is&#x2026; with one exception: Comments on this website are powered by Disqus, and I'm sure Disqus collects all kinds of data about all kinds of things. That's why comments are now hidden behind a "Load Disqus Comments" button. I promise you that no foreign Javascript is executed unless you press that button<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. And honestly, GDPR didn't even have anything to do with that. I just didn't want any foreign JavaScript.

<p>
<i>The variable $var appears to change size on every loop iteration. Consider preallocating for speed.</i>
</p>

<p>
So sayeth Matlab.
</p>

<p>
Let's try it:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-octave">x_prealloc <span style="color: #111111;">=</span> cell(10000<span style="color: #111111;">,</span> 1)<span style="color: #111111;">;</span>
x_end <span style="color: #111111;">=</span> {}<span style="color: #111111;">;</span>
x_append <span style="color: #111111;">=</span> {}<span style="color: #111111;">;</span>
<span style="color: #111111; font-weight: bold;">for</span> n<span style="color: #111111;">=</span>1<span style="color: #111111;">:</span>10000
    <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">% variant 1: preallocate</span>
    x_prealloc(n) <span style="color: #111111;">=</span> {42}<span style="color: #111111;">;</span>
    <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">% variant 2: end+1</span>
    x_end(end<span style="color: #111111;">+</span>1) <span style="color: #111111;">=</span> {42}<span style="color: #111111;">;</span>
    <span style="color: #111111; font-style: italic;">% variant 3: append</span>
    x_append <span style="color: #111111;">=</span> [x_append {42}]<span style="color: #111111;">;</span>
<span style="color: #111111; font-weight: bold;">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Which variant do you think is fastest?
</p>


<figure>
<img src="./static/2018-04/array_performance.png" alt="array_performance.png">

</figure>

<p>
Unsurprisingly, preallocation is indeed faster than growing an array. What <i>is</i> surprising is that it is faster by a constant factor of about 2 instead of scaling with the array length. Only appending by <code>x = [x {42}]</code> actually becomes slower for larger arrays. (The same thing happens for numerical arrays, struct arrays, and object arrays.)
</p>

<p>
<b>TL;DR:</b> Do not use <code>x = [x $something]</code>, ever. Instead, use <code>x(end+1) = $something</code>. Preallocation is generally overrated.

<div class="post-date">07 Apr 2018</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="2018-04-07-defeating-news-addiction.html">Defeating News Addiction</a></h1>
<p>
I want to consume the news, both because it is genuinely relevant for my work, and because conversations about news are part of my social life. But I do not want to be consumed by news, and end up scanning news websites over and over for new content, even though you know that the likelihood of finding anything interesting is small.
</p>

<p>
Over the last few months, I have tried hard to find all instances of this repeated-scanning behavior, and eliminate it. The key is to automate the scanning such that I am only ever presented with new content, but do not get hooked on the addictive variable-reward cycle of checking websites for changes over and over again.
</p>

<p>
And it all works thank to the magic of RSS:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>News Sources:</b>
I read several blogs, newspapers, and webcomics. All of them have RSS feeds. Easy.</li>

<li><b>Hacker News:</b>
The brilliant service <a href="https://hnrss.org/">hnrss.org</a> provides RSS feeds for Hacker News, and filters them to for example only include posts that made it to the front page, and have accumulated <a href="https://hnrss.org/frontpage?points=100">at least 100 points</a>.</li>

<li><b>Reddit:</b>
Every subreddit has its own feed, at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs.rss">reddit.com/r/subreddit.rss</a>. Sadly there is no way to filter for a minimum number of upvotes.</li>

<li><b>YouTube:</b>
Again, every YouTube channel has its own RSS feed, but Google is trying very hard to make it as cumbersome as possible to get at those feeds. You need to go to your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/subscription_manager">Subscription Manager</a>, then scroll all the way down, and "Export Subscriptions". The resulting file helpfully does not have a file extension, which you will have to add before you can import it into your RSS reader. I honestly can't reconstruct how I found that subscription manager, either, but presumably there is some series of clicks that would take you there.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With all this settled, I have a veritable firehose of news every day. I estimate that only 1 % of this is actually worth reading. So in the next step, I filter this list for spam. For this purpose, I use <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a>, which aggegates all these feeds, and remembers whether I have read an article. The remaining ham I either read immediately, or forward it to <a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> for later consumption.
</p>

<p>
With this system, I never miss anything, but once I consume all the news in my feed reader, I know I am done, and there is no point in checking and re-checking various websites over and over again.
