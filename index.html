<p>
The Mac. It used to be the most streamlined, thought-through general computing device on the market.
</p>

<p>
Even it's file management used to be top-notch. There were many cool little touches. One particularly useful feature was the <i>Proxy Icon</i>&#x2013;if a window displayed a file's content, that file's icon would show up in the window's title. And you could drag that icon directly onto a thumb drive or email, without having to use the Finder. But the Finder, too, had many neat little features. I loved the fact that when you renamed a file in an alphabetically sorted file list, Finder would not immediately re-shuffle it to its new location, but would wait half a second before doing so. When renaming multiple files, this was really useful, since you could go through them one by one and rename them, simply by pressing arrow keys and return.
</p>

<p>
But as you might have guessed from my use of the past tense, these golden days are gone. The Finder used to know a JPEG from a ZIP regardless of file extension. Now it doesn't any more. The Proxy Icon is still draggable, but it will create an alias instead of a copy&#x2013;perfectly useless on a thumb drive or in an email.
</p>

<p>
And with the newest version of OS X, El Capitan, they finally blew it for me. Before, even though the Finder inexplicably never had the ability to cut and paste files, you could always install programs like <a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/">TotalFinder</a> to fix that. Not so with El Capitan. The Finder now is holy land, and can not be touched any more by third parties. So no more cut and paste, no more un-hiding system files. No more side-by-side Finder tabs. And brand new with El Capitan as well: No more waiting after renaming. Now, when you rename a file, it is immediately re-sorted to its new position, thus making renaming multiple files terribly inconvenient.
</p>

<p>
So, good bye OS X. I updated my work laptop first, and I regret it. I never regretted an OS X update before. My home machine is not going to get the update. It is honestly sad to see my once-beloved Mac platform becoming worse and worse and worse with every new release.

<p>
On my last vacation, I have taken a bunch of pictures, and a bunch of video. The problem is, I hadn't used the video camera in a long time, and it believed that all it's videos were taken on the first of January 2012. So in order for the pictures to show up correctly in my picture library, I wanted to correct that.
</p>

<p>
For images, this is relatively easy: Most picture libraries support some kind of bulk date changes, and there are a bunch of <a href="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/">command</a> <a href="http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">line</a> <a href="http://www.exiv2.org/#util">utilities</a> that can do it, too. But none of these tools work for video (exiftool claims be able to do that, but I couldn't get it to work).
</p>

<p>
So instead, I went about to change the file creation date of the actual video files. And it turns out, this is surprisingly hard! The thing is, most Unix systems (a Mac is technically a Unix system) don't even know the concept of a file creation date. Thus, most Unix utilities, including most programming languages, don't know how to deal with that, either.
</p>

<p>
If you have XCode installed, this will come with <code>SetFile</code>, a command line utility that can change file creation dates. Note that <code>SetFile</code> can change <i>either</i> the file creation date, <i>or</i> the file modification date, but not both at the same time, as any normal Unix utility would. Also note that <code>SetFile</code> expects dates in American notation, which is about as nonsensical as date formats come.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, here's a small Python script that changes the file creation date (but not the time) of a bunch of video files:
</p>

<p>
They say that all arithmetic operations in Numpy behave like their element-wise cousins in Matlab. This is wrong, and seriously tripped me up last week.
</p>

<p>
In particular, this is what happens when you multiply an array with a matrix<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> in Numpy:
</p>

<pre class="example">
     [[  1],           [[1, 2, 3],       [[ 1,    2,   3],
      [ 10],       *    [4, 5, 6],   =    [ 40,  50,  60],
      [100]]            [7, 8, 9]]        [700, 800, 900]]

 [  1,  10, 100]       [[1, 2, 3],       [[  1,  20, 300],
        OR         *    [4, 5, 6],   =    [  4,  50, 600],
[[  1,  10, 100]]       [7, 8, 9]]        [  7,  80, 900]]
</pre>

<p>
They behave as if each row was evaluated separately, and singular dimensions are repeated where necessary. It helps to think about them as row-wise, instead of element-wise. This is particularly important in the second example, where the <i>whole</i> 1d-array is multiplied with <i>every row</i> of the 2d-array.
</p>

<p>
Note that this is <i>not</i> equivalent to multiplying every <i>element</i> as in <code>[a[n]*b[n] for n in range(len(a))]</code>. I guess that's why this is called <i>broadcasting</i>, and not <i>element-wise</i>.

Recently, I was working on a dynamic programming algorithm that involves a lot of number crunching in nested loops. The algorithm looks like this:

</pre>
</div>

<p>
I'm not going into the details of what this algorithm does, but note that it iterates over every column and row of the matrix <code>cost_matrix</code>, and then iterates over another range <code>previous_y_range</code> for each of the values in <code>cost_matrix</code>. On the way, it does a lot of basic arithmetic and some algebra.
</p>

<p>
The problem is, this is very slow. For a \(90 \times 200\) <code>cost_matrix</code>, this takes about 260 ms. Lots of loops? Lots of simple mathematics? Slow? That sounds like a perfect match for <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">Numpy</a>!
</p>

<p>
If you can express your code in terms of linear algebra, Numpy will execute them in highly-optimized C code. The problem is, translating loops into linear algebra is not always easy. In this case, it took some effort:

<p>
This code does not look much like the original, but calculates exactly the same thing. This takes about 15 ms for a \(90 \times 200\) <code>cost_matrix</code>, which is about 17 times faster than the original code! Yay Numpy! And furthermore, this code is arguably more readable than the original, since it is written at a higher level of abstraction.
</p>

<p>
Another avenue for performance optimization is <a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a>. Numba applies dark and powerful magic to compile humble Python functions into blazingly fast machine code. It is proper magic, if you ask me. Simply add an innocuous little decorator to your functions, and let Numba do it's thing. If all goes well, your code will work just as before, except with unheard-of performance:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #00688b;">@jit</span>(numba.float64(numba.float64), nopython=<span style="color: #6e8b3d;">True</span>)
<span style="color: #1c86ee;">def</span> <span style="color: #cd9b1d;">y_change_probability_numba</span>(doubles_per_x):
    ...

<span style="color: #00688b;">@jit</span>((numba.int64, numba.float64, numba.int64), nopython=<span style="color: #6e8b3d;">True</span>)
<span style="color: #1c86ee;">def</span> <span style="color: #cd9b1d;">y_idx_range_numba</span>(y_idx, max_y_factor, height):
    ...

<span style="color: #00688b;">@jit</span>((numba.float64[:,:], numba.float64), nopython=<span style="color: #6e8b3d;">True</span>)
<span style="color: #1c86ee;">def</span> <span style="color: #cd9b1d;">find_tracks_numba</span>(cost_matrix, delta_t):
    ...
</pre>
</div>

<p>
However, Numba is no silver bullet, and does not support all of Python yet. In the present case, it is missing support for <code>enumerate</code> for Numpy matrices. Thus, I had to rewrite the first two loops like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #7f7f7f;"># </span><span style="color: #7f7f7f;">python version</span>
<span style="color: #1c86ee;">for</span> x_idx, cost_column <span style="color: #1c86ee;">in</span> <span style="color: #cd6600;">enumerate</span>(cost_matrix):
    ...

<span style="color: #7f7f7f;"># </span><span style="color: #7f7f7f;">numba version</span>
<span style="color: #1c86ee;">for</span> x_idx <span style="color: #1c86ee;">in</span> <span style="color: #cd6600;">range</span>(<span style="color: #cd6600;">len</span>(cost_matrix)):
    <span style="color: #2e8b57;">cost_column</span> = cost_matrix[x_idx]
    ...
</pre>
</div>

Another area that proved problematic is N-D slice writing. Instead of using expressions like <code>m1[x,y:y+3] = m2</code>, you have to write <code>for idx in range(3): m1[x,y+idx] = m2[idx]</code>. Not a difficult transformation, but it basically forced me to unroll all the nice vectorized code of the Numpy version back to their original pure-Python form. That said, Numba is getting better and better, and many constructs that used to be uncompilable (<code>yield</code>) are not a problem any more.

Anyway, with that done, the above code went down from 260 ms to 2.2 ms. This is a 120-fold increase in performance, and still seven times faster than Numpy, with minimal code changes. This is proper magic!

So why wouldn't you just always use Numba? After all, when it comes down to raw performance, Numba is the clear winner. The big difference between performance optimization using Numpy and Numba is that properly vectorizing your code for Numpy often reveals simplifications and abstractions that make it easier to reason about your code. Numpy forces you to think in terms of vectors, matrices, and linear algebra, and this often makes your code <i>more beautiful</i>. Numba on the other hand often requires you to make your code <i>less beautiful</i> to conform to it's subset of compilable Python.

<p>
So I wanted to work with audio files in Matlab. In the past, Matlab could only do this with <code>auread</code> and <code>wavread</code>, which can read <i>*.au</i> and <i>*.wav</i> files. With 2012b, Matlab introduced <a href="http://mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/audioread.html"><code>audioread</code></a>, which claims to support <i>*.wav</i>, <i>*.ogg</i>, <i>*.flac</i>, <i>*.au</i>, <i>*.mp3</i>, and <i>*.mp4</i>, and simultaneously deprecated <code>auread</code> and <code>wavread</code>.
</p>

<p>
Of these file formats, only <i>*.au</i> is capable of storing more than 4 Gb of audio data. But the documentation is actually wrong: <code>audioread</code> can <i>actually</i> read more data formats than documented: it reads <i>*.w64</i>, <i>*.rf64</i>, and <i>*.caf</i> no problem. And these can store more than 4 Gb as well.
</p>

<p>
It's just that, while <code>audioread</code> supports all of these nice file formats, <a href="http://mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/audiowrite.html"><code>audiowrite</code></a> is more limited, and only supports <i>*.wav</i>, <i>*.ogg</i>, <i>*.flac</i>, and <i>*.mp4</i>. And it does not support any undocumented formats, either. So it seems that there is no way of writing files larger than 4 Gb. But for the time being, <code>auwrite</code> is still available, even though deprecated. I tried it, though, and it didn't finish writing 4.8 Gb in half an hour.
</p>

<p>
In other words, Matlab is incapable of writing audio files larger than 4 Gb. It just can't do it.
