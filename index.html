<div class="post-date">11 May 2019</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="2019-05-11-fuji-zoom-lenses.html">Fuji Zoom Lenses</a></h1>
<p>
So I bought a new camera. Now I need new lenses. In this post, I am looking for a standard zoom lens, i.e. something that covers a bit of wide-angle, all the way through the normal range, up to a bit of telephoto. In Fuji's lineup <a href="https://camerasize.com/compact/#721.706,721.421,721.359,721.426,721.448,721.388,ha,t">these needs are met by</a>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><del>the XC 15‑45 mm f/3.5‑5.6 OIS PZ (€ 150, 136 g, 4.4 cm)</del></li>
<li>the XC 16‑50 mm f/3.5‑5.6 OIS II (€ 150, 195 g, 6.5 cm)</li>
<li>the XF 18‑55 mm f/2.8‑4 R LM OIS (€ 250, 310 g, 7.0 cm)</li>
<li>the XF 18‑135 mm f/3.5‑5.6 R LM OIS WR (€ 500, 490g, 9.8 cm)</li>
<li><del>the XF 16‑55 mm f/2.8 R LM WR (€ 650, 655 g, 10.6 cm)</del></li>
<li><del>a bag of primes (€ inf, many g, lots of cm)</del></li>
<li>the XF 27 mm f/2.8 (€ 150, 78 g, 2.3 cm)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The XC 15‑45 is out, because the zoom ring is not turn-to-zoom like any other zoom lens. I tried it; I couldn't stand it. The XF 16‑55 is out because it is just too expensive and big for me. A bag of primes is not what I want, but I included the XF 27, because that's what I happened to have at hand. All of the above prices are used prices as of early 2019 in Germany.
</p>


<figure>
<img src="https://bastibe.de/static/2019-05/lenses.jpg" alt="lenses.jpg">

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>From left to right, the XC 16‑50, XF 27, XF 18‑135, XF 18‑55</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Before we get started, all of these lenses are perfectly sharp to my eyes. At least in the center-ish area of the image, every pixel shows different information, which is not something I could have said about some of the Nikon lenses I used to own. Because of that, I will not compare sharpness.
</p>

<p>
The word of mouth is that the XF 18‑55 is a stellar kit lens, the XC 16‑50 is a bit cheap, and the XF 18‑135 a bit of a compromise. If internet forums are to be believed, these differences are massive, and the XF 18‑55 is really the only acceptable non-prime lens any self-respecting Fuji fanboy can buy. But then again, that's what internet forums <i>would</i> say, right?
</p>

<p>
With that out of the way, let's have a look at these lenses! I'll use crops from a terribly boring shot <a href="https://bastibe.de/static/2019-05/example.jpg">linked here</a> for most of my examples. Why this shot? Because a), that's what was available, and b), because it contains areas that nicely showcase these lenses' qualities. All shots were taken at f/8 at 27 mm, ISO 400 and a shutter speed around 1/300 s.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgdc8f3e4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdc8f3e4">Micro Contrast</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdc8f3e4">
<p>
I often read that micro contrast really tells lenses apart. To illustrate this point, here's an area with very little overall contrast, particularly between the fence and the orange paint, and the fence and the gray stairs:
</p>


<figure>
<a href="https://bastibe.de/static/2019-05/microcontrast.jpg"><img src="https://bastibe.de/static/2019-05/microcontrast.jpg" alt="microcontrast.jpg"></a>

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>100% crops, mouse pointers near the critical areas. (Click to view bigger)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
If you look very closely, you might find the fence slightly less visible on the XC 16‑50 than on the XF 18‑135 and XF 27, and ever so slightly more visible on the 18‑55. But it should also be obvious that these differences are <i>incredibly</i> tiny, and not worth fussing over.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga224737" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga224737">Corner Sharpness and Chromatic Aberrations</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga224737">
<p>
Another common point is corner sharpness, which is typically said to strongly favor primes. This time, the images are cropped from the bottom-right corner of the image that contains some detail, but most importantly a bright white warning sign:
</p>


<figure>
<a href="https://bastibe.de/static/2019-05/cornersharpness.jpg"><img src="https://bastibe.de/static/2019-05/cornersharpness.jpg" alt="cornersharpness.jpg"></a>

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>100% crops of the image corner. (Click to view bigger)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
And indeed, the XC 16‑50 is noticeably blurry this time, with the other three lenses similarly sharp. The warning sign also highlights color fringes on the transitions from the bright white sign to the dark background. These chromatic aberrations are almost invisible on the XF 18‑55, and mild on the XF 18‑135 and XF 27.
</p>

<p>
Bear in mind, however, that these are 100% crops in the very furthest corners of a high-contrast image. In normal pictures, none of these issues will be noticeable unless you really zoom in on fine details at the edges of your frame. The chromatic aberrations seen here were already treated in software with the <i>lens correction</i> module in Darktable, but it might be possible to improve on these results with more dedicated processing.

<h2 id="org987978c">Update: Even more comparison pictures</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org987978c">
<p>
After publishing the blog post, I still wasn't satisfied: What if the results I got were only true at f/8? What if image quality got worse at a longer focal length? How does my XF 18 stack up?
</p>

<p>
To answer this, I took another set of pictures and prepared another composite of an crops near the image center, and another one near the lower right corner.
</p>

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 5: </span>100% crops of the image corner. (Click to view bigger)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
To be perfectly honest, I can not see any significant differences between any of these pictures. At this point, I am starting to question the entire concept of sharpness and micro contrast for evaluating lenses. But at least I learned a lot about how to use the Gimp.
</p>

<p>
As a sanity check, I repeated the experiment with my old Nikon 18-200, and this was in fact noticeably less sharp. And slightly overexposed. And slightly off-color. That's why I switched to Fuji. But as I said, this was a sanity check, not a fair comparison, as the Nikon D7000 body is much older than my Fuji X-E3, and the lens has surely seen better days as well.

<div id="outline-container-org6dd8f3c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6dd8f3c">Close Focus Distance and Magnification</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6dd8f3c">
<p>
And now, the darling of all photographers: out-of-focus backgrounds. Common wisdom is that the bigger the aperture, the more the background is thrown out of focus. But that's only part of the truth, and honestly, not the most interesting part for these kinds of limited-aperture lenses. Much more powerful is getting closer to your subject: The closer you focus, and the farther away your background, the more the background will be <i>out</i> of focus. This effect gets even stronger when you zoom in.
</p>


<figure>

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 6: </span>Widest (top) and longest (bottom) shots, each cropped vertically but not horizontally. All shots at f/5.6. (Click to view bigger)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The XC 16‑50 focuses much more closely than any other lens in this list, at 12 and 30 cm (Fuji says 15 cm). You can get really nice background separation with this lens, and great magnification in your macro shots. The XF 18‑55 focuses at 25 and 35 cm (Fuji: 40 cm), which is not particularly impressive. The XF 18‑135 focuses even farther, at 33 and 43 cm (Fuji: 45 cm), but gains magnification through its long tele zoom. The XF 27 is not optimized for this kind of thing at all, at 29 cm (Fuji: 34 cm).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2421e00" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2421e00">Conclusions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2421e00">
<p>
To me, the XC 16‑50 is the winner for a small/light zoom kit. It might be the least great option optically, but the differences are not dramatic at all, and it is the cheapest, smallest, and lightest lens with the most useful wide end and the closest focusing. But it lacks a dedicated aperture ring and is a plastic construction instead of a metal one, which does detract from the haptic joy somewhat.
</p>

<p>
The XF 18‑55 is optically the strongest lens. It might even beat the XF 27 prime lens on its own turf! But the optical differences to the cheaper XC 16‑50 and the more versatile XF 18‑135 are quite small, and are not be worth the price/weight/inconvenience to me.
</p>

<p>
The XF 18‑135 is really surprisingly good for what it is. The much longer focal range necessarily comes with compromises in optical quality and bulk, but it seems no significant corners where cut in this case. Considering that this lens usually replaces at least two other lenses, I even find the price reasonable. This is my first choice as a do-everything zoom kit.
</p>

<p>
The XF 27 is not very strong in any particular way, <i>except size</i>. And that size trumps all. If I just want to throw a camera in my bag without any particular photographic intentions, the XF 27 is my first choice. And possibly the XF 18, if I still have room in my bag.
</p>

<p>
As some small buying advice, the XC 16‑50 was refreshed in 2015 with the <i>OIS II</i> version, which introduced that nice close focusing distance (highly recommended). The XF 18‑135 was apparently built in two batches, the original <i>made in China</i> version that seemed to have horrible QA issues, and a second <i>made in Philippines</i> version in 2017 without.
</p>

<h2 id="orgce4b53d">What I didn't mention</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgce4b53d">
<p>
Aperture. The XF 18‑55 and XF 27 have a wider maximum aperture than the XC 16‑50 or XF 18‑135, by about two thirds of a stop. Shooting at bigger apertures makes brighter pictures with stronger background blur, and some loss in sharpness. I don't find the optical performance wide-open particularly interesting, because most of the time I'd use large apertures to blur the background, making sharpness and distortion mostly irrelevant. And as I said above, getting closer is usually more effective for background blur than maximum aperture, anyway.
</p>

<p>
Image stabilization. The three zooms offer optical image stabilization systems. From what I can tell, the XF 18‑135 is significantly more effective in this regard than the XC 16‑50 or the XF 18‑55. Hand-held shots with up to about 1/10th of a second seem easily achievable with the XF 18‑135, whereas the unstabilized XF 27 becomes blurry at 1/40th. Videos are noticeably smoother with the XF 18‑135 as well.
</p>

<p>
Weather sealing. The XF 18‑135 is weather sealed, the other lenses are not. My camera is not, so I don't care.
</p>

<p>
Distortion and Vignetting. Is fixed in post. No need obsessing over it.
</p>

<p>
Autofocus speed. Is good. No need obsessing over it.

<div class="post-date">25 Mar 2019</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="2019-03-25-on-camera-sensor-sizes.html">On camera sensor sizes</a></h1>
<p>
A common internet wisdom about photography is that bigger camera sensors capture more light. So if you want to work in low light, you need a full frame camera, and a bigger sensor is always better. I have struggled with this a lot, though, because it doesn't make sense. Lenses can focus light on any surface, so <i>why should the surface size matter</i>?
</p>

<p>
The answer turned out to be&#x2026; disappointing. Bigger sensors allow for larger (practical) apertures, and lower base ISO. But less noise for the same picture, is simply impossible with the same sensor technology. Because that's not how physics works. Let me explain.
</p>

<p>
Let's talk about three sensor sizes, full frame (FF), APS-C, and micro four thirds (MFT). For the sake of discussion, let's assume that these sensor sizes are always a factor of \(\sqrt{2}\) of each other, which is close enough to the truth. So FF is twice the area of APS-C, which is twice the area of MFT. Let's also assume that our hypothetical cameras at these sizes use sensors with the same resolution, and using the same technology. With that out of the way, what does it mean to use a smaller sensor?
</p>

<p>
If you shrink the sensor area by a factor of two, every pixels gets equally smaller, and receives less light (on the same lens). To fix this, and account for the different field of view due to cropping, we zoom out, dividing the focal length by \(\sqrt{2}\). So now a FF 35mm f4 lens will get the same field of view and brightness as an APS-C 23mm f4 lens, or a 17mm MFT f4 lens, all at the same ISO number. The only difference being, that due to the smaller sensor, MFT will be twice as noisy as APS-C, which is twice as noisy as FF. This seems like a clear win for FF, right?
</p>

<p>
As an aside, isn't it cool that we actually get the same brightness, as long as ISO and f-numbers are kept the same? That's what they are designed to say: Equal ISO and f-number means equal brightness! (But not equal noise, or, as we will see, equal depth of field).
</p>

<p>
Because here's the catch: Even though the f-number is the same, the physical size of the aperture is bigger on the bigger sensor! This makes sense, because to get the same brightess on a bigger sensor area, you need more light. And to get more light, you need a bigger aperture. This also means that the depth of field on the FF sensor is twice as big as on the APS-C sensor, which is twice as big as the MFT sensor.
</p>

<p>
So let's account for that, too, and give each camera a lens with the same physical aperture size as well as field of view, and stop down ISO to account for the increase in brightness: FF 35mm f4 ISO 1600 then becomes APS-C 23mm f2.8 ISO 800 and MFT 17mm f2 ISO 400. These combinations now actually have the same field of view, same brightness, same depth of field, and, you guessed it, same noise. If you account for field of view, there is no advantage to FF whatsoever. You can get the very same picture on a big sensor as on a small sensor, the only difference being how much you are willing to carry and pay for it.
</p>

<p>
OK, that's not quite true: You can get FF lenses at f1 (equivalent to f0.7 on APS-C or f0.5 on MFT), which are just not available on smaller sensors. But have you used such lenses? At this point, the area in focus is literally razor-thin, and focusing becomes terrifyingly difficult. You might also notice that wider-aperture lenses are generally bigger. They have to be, to capture more light. By the same token, an f1.4 APS-C lens will be the same size as an f2 FF lens (because it is in fact mostly identical). And FF offers smaller base ISOs. If you need the minimum amount of noise, ISO 100 on FF would be equivalent to ISO 25 on MFT, which you just can't get, there.
</p>

<p>
TL;DR: Bigger sensors afford bigger apertures, with all their associated downsides. But they do not magically reduce image noise (everything else being equal). Also, cameras are surprisingly complex beasts.

<div class="post-date">13 Mar 2019</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="2019-03-13-learning-about-photography-sunstars.html">Learning about Photography: Sunstars</a></h1>
<p>
Normally, when you take a picture of something too bright, you get <i>bloom</i>: An all-consuming brightness that plunges everything around it into pure whiteness. Ugly.
</p>

<p>
But if the light source is <i>reeeally</i> tiny, and your aperture is <i>teeeensy</i> as well, you get something else: sunstars
</p>


<figure>
<img src="https://bastibe.de/static/2019-03/sunstar.jpg" alt="sunstar.jpg">

</figure>

<p>
This particular sunstar has fourteen corners, and therefore comes from a seven-bladed aperture (in my Fuji XC 16-50). It happens because tiny apertures are not perfectly circular any longer, but instead, in my case, septagonal, and therefore bloom more in some directions than in others. The effect is kind of beautiful.
</p>

<p>
In this picture, the sun was just barely peeking into the edge between the tree and the building, and my aperture was set to its smallest setting, f22. I actually wanted to capture the raindrops on the branches, which I largely failed at. In the end, the picture didn't turn out very pretty, but at least I got some fine sunstars!

<div class="post-date">24 Feb 2019</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="2019-02-24-what-i-learned-about-amateur-photography.html">What I learned about Amateur Photography</a></h1>
<p>
I am an amateur, as in "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur">lover of</a>", photography. I love cameras as tactile devices, I love how photography makes me consider the world as art, how that little viewfinder can reveal unknown beauty in well-known places or people. And I love looking at my photos, and remembering vacations and meaningful moments. For me, photography is about finding beauty, and capturing memories.
</p>

<p>
However, most of the writing on photography seems to be focused not on my needs, but the needs of professional photographers: A super competitive field of visual artists who compete on image quality and novelty, and use crazy and expensive gear. I have found many of their lessons not applicable to my amateur needs, or even actively detrimental:
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd56614f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd56614f">Embrace the noise</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd56614f">
<p>
Many pros limit their ISO numbers, because high-ISO noise is ugly. Which it is. But you know what is even worse for an amateur? Not having that picture of my baby, because it was too dark.
</p>

<p>
So I set my ISO to unlimited, reduce my shutter speed and aperture so I actually have a chance of capturing my fast-moving toddler. And embrace the ensuing noise. Some of my favorite pictures look unbearably noisy on my 4k screen, but look just fine when printed, or on a smartphone (the two most important mediums in the world).
Because of this, I find noise reduction rarely worth the effort. Color heavy noise reduction works ok, but anything else looks worse than the problem. I vastly prefer a sharp, noisy shot to a mushy denoised shot with no detail.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7b6ee14" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7b6ee14">Step it down</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7b6ee14">
<p>
Another common Pro argument: Wider apertures are better. Which they are, <i>at capturing light</i>, and <i>blurring the background</i>. But as an amateur, a wide-aperture super-shallow depth of field just makes me miss shots. At f1.8, the area in focus is barely a few centimetres deep. I missed too many shots because I accidentally focused on the nose instead of the eye. So, in the absence of studio lighting, and arbitrarily many retries, I prefer to step it down and live with the noise, if need be.
</p>

<p>
As a fun corollary, all those fancy prime lenses with crazy-wide apertures, they are simply wasted on me. Anything beyond, say, f2.8, is not something I need to spend money on.
Also, lenses are noticeably sharper when stepped down! I have been disappointed with the sharpness of a number of shots because I forgot to step it down. Nowadays, I typically shoot at f5.6 or f8, and only go wider if I actually need to, because of lack of light, or if I specifically want a blurry background.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6bedd06" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6bedd06">Wide-ish lenses are easier</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6bedd06">
<p>
I wondered, for a long time, why pros seem to like long-ish lenses for portraits: The answer is, because longer lenses have a shallower the depth of field (for the same f-number), and pro photographers love their blurry backgrounds. But as I said before, that is not for me.
</p>

<p>
Instead, I prefer wide-ish lenses. If something is too small on a wide-ish lens, it is usually no problem to get a bit closer or to crop afterwards. If something is too big on a long lens though, backing off is often not possible, and you miss your shot<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. Plus, wide-ish angles don't blur as much from shaky hands, and are more compact. They often focus more closely, too, which is a huge bonus if you want to take pictures of a toddler.
</p>

<p>
I have tried, unsuccessfully, a 50mm and 35mm prime (APS-C). Now I own a 27mm pancake prime, which I find perfect: long enough to get nice portraits, but still wide enough to capture a landscape.
</p>

<p>
Be careful with super-wide angle lenses, though. Even though they are a ton of fun, I have found anything below 16mm to be very difficult to <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/how-to-use-ultra-wide-lenses.htm">use effectively</a>. It's just too easy to get that fisheye-distorted look, especially near the sides. That distorted look, by the way, is caused by being too close, not by lens distortion. The same thing happens if you take a longer lens or a cell phone and get too close. Just don't do that.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgaef3fcc" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgaef3fcc">Gear</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgaef3fcc">
<p>
Pros use the biggest sensor they can get, to get the best image quality possible. But that also makes everything else much more cumbersome: Bigger sensors mean bigger and heavier bodies. And bigger and heavier lenses. And shallower depth of field (see above). And smaller focal ranges, hence more lens changing. And, not least of all, much, much, much higher prices. It is not for me.
</p>

<p>
To some extent, the same goes for different quality levels: Personally, I have found entry-level APS-C mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras a good compromise. These entry-level plastic lenses and cameras are usually smaller, lighter, and cheaper than their higher-end brethren, but compromise on robustness and aperture sizes (e.g. <a href="https://camerasize.com/compact/#493.421,520.359,7.351,ha,t">Fuji X-E2 375g/€250 + Fuji XC 16-50mm, 195g/€150 vs. Fuji X-T1 450g/€250 + Fuji XF 18-55mm, 300g/€250 vs. my old Nikon gear</a>). And for my everyday camera, I' take a <a href="https://camerasize.com/compact/#493.388,ha,t">smaller, pocketable camera</a> over a "better", bigger one any day.
</p>

<p>
Haptics are important, too. I have seen great cameras and lenses that just didn't feel good in my hand. Which meant I wouldn't ever take them with me, and wouldn't take any pictures with them. I now go try stuff in the store before I buy anything. This has talked me out of a number of unnecessary purchases, internet consensus notwithstanding.
</p>

<p>
And finally, I buy used gear. Cameras and lenses depreciate about 70% within the first two years, without losing any quality. A great camera from two years ago is still a great camera, but costs a third of the original price, and can be resold without loss. And is better for the environment. Win-win-win.

I have found many "common" rules about photography useless for my amateur needs. I have found cheap, plastic, used gear more useful than pro gear. I have found noisy, small-aperture pictures to be better at capturing important memories than clean, "professional" ones. I have found haptics, size and weight to be much more important than ultimate image quality (within reason).
</p>

<p>
The funny thing is, you don't find this kind of information on the internet, since most review websites seem to focus on the professional viewpoint, even for gear that is clearly meant for amateurs like me.

<p>
There is no other media more immersive to me than reading. When I read, I dive deep into another world, and seize to perceive the reality around me. It is my escape from the everyday stresses of living in the modern world. Reading is truly sacred to me. So here are my favorite pieces of writing of 2018:

<p>
This is a book about deep wreck diving. I am not interested in wrecks, or diving. Nevertheless, no book gripped me as hard last year as Shadow Divers. At first, I was a bit thrown off by the writing style, and thought it dramatized things too much. But I just couldn't put this book down. There were times when I surfaced from reading with a distinct feeling of having been there, of having touched that menacing shipwreck at the bottom of the ocean.
</p>

<p>
By the end of it, I was entirely engrossed in the story and its characters and the history of the mystery wreck. And then, in the epilogue, I learned that what I had thought embellished at first was actually meticulously researched and not overdramatic at all.
</p>

<p>
And best of all, my favorite podcast, <a href="http://omegataupodcast.net">Omega Tau</a> had <a href="http://omegataupodcast.net/33-deep-wreck-diving/">an interview</a> with the main protagonist of the book, which is just fascinating!

<p>
This book is a strange choice to put on my list of books, because I didn't like it too much. I found it offputting which parts of history the author emphasized, and which parts he skipped. Apparently, the two world wars did not bear mentioning. The book paints a strangely specific west-vs-east map of Germany, which is not without merit, but surely not the whole story. And worst of all, I really didn't care for the writing style at all.
</p>

<p>
But when I look back on 2018, this book has stuck with me. Never mind its shortcomings, it has given me a map of Germany's history that I can fit other pieces of knowledge into. And that makes it valuable to me.

I love short stories. And this one is just brilliant. It is by Sarah Pinsker, about Sarah Pinsker, and all Sarah Pinskers from neighboring parallel universes. Every character in this book is a Sarah Pinsker. And all of them agree, Sarah is no murderer. Yet, one of them has been found murdered.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2c7704a">
<p>
For years now, I have struggled to find graphic novels that speak to me. I usually find the drawing style off-putting, and would have preferred a more fleshed out novel instead of a shallow graphic novel. But this year, I found two brilliant graphic novels that I loved dearly:
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgcc4c278" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgcc4c278"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15195.The_Complete_Maus">Maus</a></h3>

<p>
The half-auto-biographical narrative of a survivor of one the Nazi concentration camps. The novel juxtaposes the author's struggle to interview his father about his past, and thereby shows both the cruelty of the father's experience, and the man that this experience created. Both of these perspectives add weight to the unspeakable nastiness of the Holocaust.
</p>

<p>
But beyond that, it is also a story of humanity, struggle, and the small moments of joy amidst all the terror. Truly a masterpiece of a book.

In sharp contrast to the previous book, Nimona is just plain fun! Nimona is a teenage girl, and a shark, and the sidekick of Balister Blackheart, the biggest name in Supervillainy. And if you haven't guessed it from this description, it is wacky, and funny, and uplifting, and just&#x2026; fun!
</p>

<p>
You can read the first three chapters <a href="http://gingerhaze.com/nimona">online</a>, and then you'll want to read the rest, too. It's just too much fun!
