<p>
A while ago, I scratched an old itch and wrote my own static site generator, called <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog">org-static-blog</a>. It is a simple thing: You hand it a directory full of *.org files with a <code>#+title:</code> and <code>#+date:</code>, and it assembles a bunch of HTML pages and an RSS feed from them. There are no external dependencies beyond Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Today, I <a href="http://melpa-stable.milkbox.net/#/org-static-blog">released</a> version 1.1.0 of org-static-blog, which introduces two new features: <a href="http://bastibe.de/2018-03-17-speeding-up-org-static-blog.html">speed</a>, and tags. You can now—optionally—add <code>#+tags:</code> to your *.org files, <code>(setq org-static-blog-enable-tags t)</code>, and org-static-blog will add tag links to every blog post, create tag indices, and add <code>&lt;category&gt;</code> tags to the RSS feed.
</p>
<div class="taglist"><a href="tags.html">Tags:</a> <a href="tag-blog.html">blog</a> </div>
<div class="post-date">17 Mar 2018</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="2018-03-17-speeding-up-org-static-blog.html">Speeding up org-static-blog</a></h1>
<p>
Three years ago, I had enough of all the static site generators out there. Over the life of this blog, I had used <a href="http://bastibe.de/2012-07-18-blogging-with-pelican.html">Octopress, then Pelican</a>, then <a href="http://bastibe.de/2013-11-13-blogging-with-emacs.html">Coleslaw</a>, then <a href="http://bastibe.de/2014-05-07-speeding-up-org-publishing.html">org-mode</a>, and then wrote my own static site generator, <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog">org-static-blog</a>. Above all, org-static-blog is <i>simple</i>. It iterates over all *.org files in <code>org-static-blog-posts-directory</code>, and then exports all of these files to HTML. Simple is good. Simple is reliable. Simple means I can fix things.
</p>

<p>
However, simple can also mean inefficient. Most glaringly, org-static-blog exports every single blog post three times every time you publish: Once to render the HTML, then once to render the RSS feed, then once to render the Index and Archive pages.
</p>

<p>
Today, I finally tackled this problem: Now, org-static-blog only exports each post once, when the *.org file changes. The RSS feed, the Index page, and the Archive page simply read the already-rendered HTML instead of exporting again.
</p>

<p>
Thus, a full rebuild of this blog and all of its 85 posts used to take 2:12 min, and now takes 42 s. More importantly, if only one org file changed, the rebuild used to take 1:08 min, and now takes 1.5 s. Things like this are hugely satisfying to me!

<div class="post-date">24 Jan 2018</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="2018-01-24-files-and-processes.html">Files and Processes</a></h1>
<p>
In the last few months, I have created three notable programming projects: <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/RunForrest">RunForrest</a> saves function call graphs to disk and runs them in parallel processes; <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/timeup">TimeUp</a> creates backups using rsync and keeps different numbers of hourly, daily, and weekly backups; and <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/jbof">JBOF</a>, which organizes large collections of data and metadata as structured, on-disk datasets.
</p>

<p>
These projects have one thing in common: They use Python to interact with external <i>things</i>, such as files, libraries, or processes. It surprised me that none of these projects were particularly hard to build, even though they accomplish "hard" tasks. This prompted some soul-searching about why I thought these tasks to be hard, and I have come up with two observations:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Files and processes are considered "not part of the language", and are therefore not taught. Most programming classes and programming tutorials I have seen focus on the internals of a programming language, i.e. its data structures, and built-in functions and libraries. Files and processes are not part of this, and are often only mentioned in passing, as a thing that a particularly library can do. Worse, many curricula never formally explain files or processes, or their use in building programs.

<p>
I now believe that this is unfortunate and misguided, since the interaction with the computer's resources is the central benefit of programming, and you can not make much use of those resources without a thorough understanding of files and processes. In a way, the "inside" of a programming language is a mere sandbox, a safe place for toying with imaginary castles. But it is the "outside", that is, external programs, libraries, and files, that unlocks the true power of making the computer do work. And in Python in particular, using these building blocks to build useful programs is surprisingly simple.
</p>
</li>

<li>However, such small and simple programs are much less popular than bloated behemoths. I built RunForrest explicitly because <a href="http://dask.pydata.org">Dask</a> was too confusing and unpredictable for the job. I build JBOF because <a href="http://www.h5py.org/">h5py</a> was too complex and slow. And this is surprising, since these tools certainly are vastly more mature than anything I can whip up. But they were developed by large organizations to solve large-organization problems. But I am not a large organization, and my needs are different as well.

<p>
I now believe that such small-scale solutions are often preferable to high-profile tools, but they lack the visibility and publicity of tools such as Dask and HDF. And even worse, seeing these big tools solve such mundane problems, we form the belief that these problems must be incredibly complex, and beyond our abilities. Thus forms a vicious cycle. Of course, this is not to say that these big tools do not serve a purpose. Dask and HDF were built to solve particular problems, but we should be aware that most big tools were built for big problems, and our own problems are often not big enough to warrant their use.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In summary, we should teach people about files and processes, and empower them to tackle "hard" tasks without resorting to monolithic libraries. Not only is this incredibly satisfying, it also leads to better programs and better programmers.

<div class="post-date">29 Dec 2017</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="2017-12-29-rsnapshot-on-macos.html">How to set up rsnapshot instead of Time Machine</a></h1>
<p>
(This blog post was changed since my initial strategy of disabling the lockfile didn't work. Turns out, the lockfile is required, and backups have to be stacked.)
</p>

<p>
Yesterday, I wrote about how Time Machine has failed me. Time Machine keeps regular backups, going back as far as your hard drive space permits. In theory. In practice, every year or so it messes up somehow and has to start over, thereby deleting all your older backups. A backup that is not reliable is not a backup.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, there are alternatives. Probably the easiest is <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a><sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, a very cool tool that copies files and directories from one place to another. You could simply run this once a day, and have a new backup every day. You can even configure rsync so it doesn't need to copy unchanged files, and instead hard-links them from an older backup. <a href="http://rsnapshot.org/">rsnapshot</a> automates this process to keep a number of tiered copies, for example ten hourly backups, seven daily backups, four weekly backups, and a hundred monthly backups. Each backup is then simply a directory that contains your files. No fancy starfield-GUI, but utterly reliable and trivial to understand <sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Setting up rsnapshot on macOS is not quite as straight-forward as I'd like, and I couldn't find a great guide online. So, without further ado, here's how to configure rsnapshot on macOS:
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Install rsnapshot

<pre class="example">
brew install rsnapshot
</pre>
</li>

<li>Write the config file

<p>
You can copy a template from homebrew:
</p>
<pre class="example">
cp /usr/local/Cellar/rsnapshot/1.4.2/etc/rsnapshot.conf.default /usr/local/etc/rsnapshot.conf
</pre>
<p>
And then configure the new configuration file to your liking (preserve the tabs!):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-config">config_version	1.2 # default
verbose		2   # default
loglevel	3   # default

# this is where your backups are stored:
snapshot_root	/Volumes/BBackup/Backups.rsnapshot/ # make sure this is writeable
# prevent accidental backup corruption:
lockfile	/Users/bb/.rsnapshot.pid
# use this if you back up to an external drive:
no_create_root	1   # don't back up if the external drive is not connected

# configure how many tiers of backups are created:
retain	hourly	10
retain	daily	7   # dailies will only be created once 10 hourlies exist
retain	weekly	4   # weeklies will only be created once 7 dailies exist
retain	monthly	100 # monthlies will only be created once 4 weeklies exist

# the list of directories you want to back up:
backup	/Users/bb/Documents		localhost/
backup	/Users/bb/eBooks		localhost/
backup	/Users/bb/Movies		localhost/
backup	/Users/bb/Music		localhost/
backup	/Users/bb/Pictures		localhost/
backup	/Users/bb/Projects		localhost/
backup	/Users/bb/Projects-Archive		localhost/
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Instead of <code>localhost</code>, you can use remote machines as well. Check  <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.html"><code>man rsync</code></a> for details
</p>
</li>

<li>Make sure it works and create initial backup

<pre class="example">
rsnapshot -c /usr/local/etc/rsnapshot.conf hourly
</pre>
<p>
The first backup will take a while, but subsequent backups will be fast. A normal backup on my machine takes about two minutes and runs unnoticeably in the background.
</p>
</li>

<li>Write launchd Agent

<p>
Next, we have to tell macOS to run the backups in regular intervals. Conceptually, you do this by writing a launchd agent script<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>, which tells launchd when and how to run your backups. In my case, I create four files in <code>/Users/bb/Library/LaunchAgents/</code>, called <code>rsnapshot.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}.plist</code>. Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/ScheduledJobs.html">documentation</a> for these files is only mildly useful (as usual), but <a href="https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/launchd.plist.5.html"><code>man launchd.plist</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/plist.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/plist"><code>man plist</code></a> should give you an idea how this works.
</p>

<p>
Here is my hourly launchd agent (I'll explain the bash/sleep thing later):

</ul>
<p>
However, <code>rsnapshot</code> can only ever run one backup at a time without stepping on its own toes. This is a problem when the computer wakes up, and more than one backup was scheduled during its sleep, since launchd will then happily launch all missed backups at the same time. But only one of them will succeed.
</p>

<p>
To fix this, I delay the later backup tiers using the <code>sleep 0</code> directive. I use <code>sleep 900</code> (15 minutes later) for daily, <code>sleep 1800</code> (30 minutes), and <code>sleep 2700</code> (45 minutes) for the lower tiers<sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>. It seems that there should be a more elegant solution than this, but I haven't found one.
</p>

<p>
From the documentation, you might think that <code>&lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;</code> would be more succinct than supplying the binary as the first argument of <code>&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;</code>, but this apparently uses a different syntax and does not in fact work as expected.
</p>
</li>

<li>Load launchd agents

<pre class="example">
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/rsnapshot.*
</pre>
</li>

<li>Test launchd agent

<pre class="example">
launchctl start rsnapshot.hourly
</pre>
<p>
If it doesn't work, Console.app might show a relevant error message.
</p>
</li>

<li>Remove backup directory from Spotlight

<p>
Go to System Preferences → Spotlight → Privacy → Add your <code>snapshot_root</code> directory from earlier
</p>
</li>

<li>Disable TimeMachine and delete your existing backup (if you want)

<p>
Start Time Machine, right-click any directory you want to delete, and select "delete all backups of $dir"
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The configuration file of rsnapshot says that you might experience data corruption if you run several copies of rsnapshot at the same time (and you can use the lockfile to prevent this). This is a problem if your computer is asleep while rsnapshot is scheduled to run, since launchd will then re-schedule all missed tasks at once when the computer wakes up. If you enable the lockfile, only one of them will run.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, only the hourly task will actually create a new backup. All higher-level backup tiers merely copy existing backups around, so <i>in theory</i>, they shouldn't step on each other's toes when run concurrently. I have opened <a href="https://github.com/rsnapshot/rsnapshot/issues/200">an issue</a> asking about this.
</p>

<p>
There are other possible solutions: ① You could modify the launchd entry such that backups only trigger after a few minutes or, better yet, only once all other instances of rsnapshot have finished. I am not sure if launchd supports this, though. ② You could schedule the hourly task using cron instead of launchd, since cron will <i>not</i> reschedule missed tasks. This would only work for two tiers of backups, though. ③ You could just ignore the issue and hope for the best. After all, if a daily or hourly backup gets corrupted every now and then, you still have enough working backups&#x2026;

<p>
Dropbox deleted some of my favorite photos. Have you looked at all your old pictures lately and checked if they are still there? I have, and they were not. Of course Dropbox denies it is their fault, but no other program routinely accessed my pictures. <a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Missing-files-and-folders/Randomly-deleted-files-and-folders/td-p/203952">I am not alone with this problem</a>. It must have happened some time between the summer of 2015, when I put my pictures on Dropbox, and the summer of 2016, when Time Machine last corrupted its backups and had to start over, thereby deleting my last chance of recovering my pictures. The pictures are gone for good.

<p>
So, what have I learned? Dropbox loses your data, and Time Machine can't restore it. These programs are obviously no good for backups. Let me repeat this: <b>Dropbox and Time Machine are not a backup!</b> A true backup needs to be reliable, keep an infinite history, and <i>never</i>, <i>never</i>, <i>never</i> accidentally delete files.

From now on, I will use <a href="http://rsnapshot.org/">rsnapshot</a> for backups. <a href="https://rayed.com/wordpress/?p=1693">Here</a>'s a tutorial on how to set it up on a Mac. I have used rsnapshot for years at work, and it has never let me down. For syncronizing things between computers, I now use <a href="https://syncthing.net/">syncthing</a>. Both of these programs are not as user-friendly as Dropbox or Time Machine, but that is a small price to pay for a working backup.

A few years ago, I had high hopes that <a href="http://bastibe.de/2009-03-14-get-a-mac.html">Apple</a> and <a href="http://bastibe.de/2009-03-28-synchronisieren-von-google.html">Dropbox</a> and Google and Amazon would lead us to a bright future of computers that "just work", and could solve our daily chores ever more conveniently and reliably. But I was proven wrong. <a href="http://bastibe.de/2012-07-09-apple-is-failing-me.html">So</a>. <a href="http://bastibe.de/2012-11-01-apple-tv.html">Many</a>. <a href="http://bastibe.de/2015-10-16-finder-woes.html">Times</a>. It seems that for-profit software inevitably becomes less dependable as it adds ever more features to attract ever more users. In contrast, free software can focus on <a href="http://bastibe.de/2017-10-24-the-long-game.html">incremental improvements and steadily increasing reliability</a>.
